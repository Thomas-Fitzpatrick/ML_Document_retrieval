This was testing the Non-PDF simple case, as described in Section 5.2 of my Report.
This run used the Random Forest classifier with the tf-idf model.

This was by far my most successful model.

Positive Set:
Non-PDF syllabi from summer work

Negative Set:
Non-PDF non-syllabi gathered by running the crawler without a classifier and selecting pages that weren't
syllabi.
