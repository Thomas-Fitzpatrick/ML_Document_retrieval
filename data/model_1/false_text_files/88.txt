The bachelor of science in computer science at CU Denver prepares students for such creative work. The emphasis is on fundamental concepts and basic principles with a long useful life. The Computer Science Bachelor of Science program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The Program Educational Objectives (PEO) of the undergraduate computer science program are to produce graduates who: Advance professionally as productive, practicing professionals in computer science and related careers through the continued development of their expertise and skills; Further develop their knowledge, skill set, and career opportunities through graduate education and/or professional studies. Function effectively as a part of a team to succeed in their professional careers.

If you're a pre-engineering student who is already admitted to CU Denver, apply directly to the College of Engineering and Applied Science by submitting an intra-university transfer (IUT) application and a copy of your CU Denver transcript to North Classroom, Room 3034. The IUT application can be picked up from the Registrar's Office in Student Commons room 5005, or from the College of Engineering Dean's Office in North Classroom, Room 3034. Refer to the BS-CS Handbook for complete advising and degree requirements. Tab Content TwoThe required minimum number of semester hours for the bachelor of science degree is 128. You must satisfactorily complete all the course work in the curriculum shown below, satisfy all the graduation requirements and maintain at least a 2.0 grade-point average in all courses. Prerequisite courses must be completed with a letter grade of C- or better. Tab Content ThreeIf you have been admitted in Pre-engineering, contact the Academic Success and Advising Center, for an appointment and initial advising at 303-352-3520. If you've been admitted into the College of Engineering and Applied Science, you must meet with a Computer Science advisor. Call the Computer Science and Engineering Office for an appointment. Curriculum All newly admitted students are obligated to follow the curriculum that is in place at the time they are admitted into the College of Engineering and Applied Science. Under some conditions, it is possible to switch to the requirements of a new curriculum if the revision(s) occurred after your admittance. Prerequisite requirements are strictly enforced for all computer science (CSCI) courses. Faculty Advisor Regular visits with your faculty advisor are mandatory and help to verify satisfactory progress toward the BS in CS degree. Students are assigned a faculty advisor and must meet with their advisor every semester in order to enroll for the upcoming semester. It is advised that students get to know additional faculty well enough that they can serve as references in the future for employment or when applying to a graduate school. 30-Hour Senior Checkout After completing approximately 100 semester hours toward the BS CS degree, you must request a 30-hour senior checkout. You must have no more than 35 credit hours remaining to graduate before requesting the 30-hour senior checkout. During this checkout, the courses that you still need to complete are identified. The study program sheet serves as a record of a 30-hour senior checkout. Call the Department of Computer Science and Engineering Office for an appointment. Graduation Plan Prior to the last semester before graduation you must meet with your advisor and complete a graduation plan. This identifies the courses that need to be satisfactorily completed during the final semester of your program. Tab Content FourCU Denver students taking courses elsewhere If you're admitted to the College of Engineering and Applied Science and wish to take courses outside CU Denver to meet graduation requirements, you must obtain prior departmental approval via an approved petition. If approved, the credit hours earned are included in your program via requests for formal transfer advising. Formal transfer advising can be done only after the CU Denver Office of Admissions has issued an Applicant Transfer Credit Evaluation and you have been admitted to the College of Engineering and Applied Science. If you wish to receive transfer advising for credits related to the computer science curriculum, call the CSE office to make an appointment with an advisor. If you are a pre-engineering student intending to transfer and major in CS, you must meet with an advisor in the Student Academic Success Office. All your non-CS transfer credits for science, general education, and Math will evaluated in that office. Petitions Any deviations from the published curriculum must be approved before taking the alternate course or taking courses concurrently that are normally taken in sequence. Approval is obtained via an approved CS department petition. Petitions requesting a curricular deviation must be submitted to the CSE department office. Please note that it takes about two weeks to process any petition, especially at the beginning of the semester. Drop policy If you wish to drop a class after the official deadline, you must file a petition with an attached and signed drop/add form. However, no student may drop a class within two-weeks prior to the end of the semester. Required cumulative GPA To remain in good standing with the College of Engineering and Applied Science you must maintain at least a 2.0 cumulative GPA for all courses. Required study-program GPA To graduate with a degree from the College of Engineering and Applied Science you must have at least a 2.0 GPA for all courses that are counted as part of the study program. Required departmental GPA To graduate with a degree from the CSE department you must have at least a 2.0 GPA for all CS courses attempted. Students planning to continue to Master of Science in Computer Science at CU Denver Undergraduate students that perform above average (3.5 GPA) and have completed all required junior-level courses may take up to two 5000-level MS Computer Science courses with instructor permission. These courses will count as electives for the BS degree and will also be applied toward the MS degree. Students must have a faculty sponsor to do this. University and college requirements These rules of the undergraduate program of the CSE department are complementary to the policies, regulations and requirements of the University of Colorado Denver and the College of Engineering and Applied Science. The relevant information about these rules and policies is published annually in the University of Colorado Denver catalog.
