You need JavaScript enabled to view it ) A Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS) is available for students in the College of Engineering as preparation for a professional career or for advanced professional or academic study. You came to Tufts because of its top-notch Engineering School. Grow further in your studies with a Degree in Computer Science. The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. (http://www.abet.org/). Engineering students who choose a degree in computer science may not select the computer science concentration offered through the College of Arts and Sciences as a second major in a double major program, or as a major in the combined five-year liberal arts-engineering program. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences who wish to major in Computer Science are referred to the Major in Computer Science in the School of Arts and Sciences webpage. Mission Statement The mission of the Computer Science in Engineering (BSCS) program is to provide graduates with the durable knowledge necessary to become future leaders in the rapidly evolving discipline of Computer Science as well as in other computer-related fields. We aim to give each graduate a solid foundation in both Computer Science theory and programming practice, and to prepare each graduate for further advanced study in Computer Science and related fields. We aim to expose each graduate to the challenges and research problems involved in creating new kinds of computer software. We aim to give graduates the skills and commitment to lifelong learning necessary to prepare them to be effective employees or graduate students in computer-related fields. The faculty is dedicated to accomplishing this mission through integration of teaching and research. Our program objectives describe the kind of success and career for which we wish to prepare you as a graduate. Two to five years after graduation, graduates of the BSCS program will have: succeeded and advanced in professional careers in or related to computing or software. been admitted to and advanced in graduate study in computer science. In other words, we want to give you what you need to succeed. Our program outcomes describe "what you can expect to be able to do after graduation." The outcomes of the BSCS program include that: Graduates should be able to use computer-science theory to analyze algorithms and to reason about properties of programs, including structure, behavior, and performance. Graduates should be able to solve problems by using principled methods to create, extend, and improve software. Graduates should have had practice applying their knowledge and skills to open-ended problems with more than one good answer. Graduates should have practice working in teams. We believe that these outcomes assure the above objectives. As well, the department believes that the ABET CAC Criterion 3 outcomes (sometimes called "ABET CAC A-K") will help students succeed, and we strive to produce these outcomes as well. The ABET CAC outcomes include: An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline An ability to analyze a problem, and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution An ability to design, implement, and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs An ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal An understanding of professional, ethical, legal, security and social issues and responsibilities An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences An ability to analyze the local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society Recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in continuing professional development An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice. An ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices. An ability to apply design and development principles in the construction of software systems of varying complexity. In summary, we seek to provide students with the best possible preparation for a career or further study in computing and related technologies. You are invited to visit us and learn more!
