State Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 Open to PhD students and faculty engaged in causal inference in education research. From the speaker's bio: Nicole M. Fortin is a Professor of Economics at the University of British Columbia, where she received her Ph.D. She is also a research fellow in the SIIWB program of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and a research director at CLSRN. Her research interests focus on two themes: on the one hand, wage inequality and its links to labour market institutions, higher education policies, and more recently occupational tasks, and on the other hand, issues linked to gender equality, the economic progress of women, and gender role attitudes. Her contributions in applied econometrics, published in Econometrica, comprise the widely used DFL reweighting decomposition methodology and the newer RIF(recentered influence function) regression methodology. About CIERS: The objective of the Causal Inference in Education Research Seminar (CIERS) is to engage students and faculty from across the university in conversations around education research using various research methodologies. This seminar provides a space for doctoral students and faculty from the School of Education, Ford School of Public Policy, and the Departments of Economics, Sociology, Statistics, and Political Science to discuss current research and receive feedback on works-in-progress. Discourse between these schools and departments creates a more complete community of education scholars, and provides a networking opportunity for students enrolled in a variety of academic programs who share common research interests. Open to PhD students and faculty engaged in causal inference in education research.
