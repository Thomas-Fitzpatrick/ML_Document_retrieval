This flexibility will be increasingly important in the future as computers become more important tools in an ever-increasing number of disciplines. About this Major College: Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering Degree: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Credits for Degree: 120 Academic Learning Compact Additional Information Related Computer Science Programs To graduate with this major, students must complete all university, college, and major requirements. Critical TrackingModel Semester Plan Overview Students in the engineering computer science (EG-CSE) program will satisfy the same requirements for general education and obtain the same engineering preprofessional background in mathematics and science as other engineering students. The program contains a strong technical component comprising a set of required courses covering essential areas in computing and a set of technical electives enabling students to deepen their knowledge in chosen areas of computer science and engineering. In addition, the program includes a set of interdisciplinary electives in an area of the student's choice from anything the university offers. Students may choose an established minor, a predefined track or if nothing meets their needs, they can work with an advisor to develop their own program. Thus, students will not need to wait for an interdisciplinary program to be established; they can create their own. To answer the demands of industry for employees with both technical competence and the ability to communicate effectively, the program requires communication courses beyond the usual general education requirements for engineering. Back to Top Department Requirements Students must complete all critical-tracking courses with minimum grades of C in each course and the critical-tracking GPA must be 2.5 minimum. A minimum grade of C is required in all other courses that are prerequisites to a required course: CDA 3101, COP 3503, COP 3530, COP 4600, COT 3100 and MAS 3114. In addition, CISE requires all computer science students to maintain a cumulative, upper-division and department grade point average minimum of 2.0. Students who do not meet these requirements will be placed on academic probation and will be required to prepare a probation contract with a CISE advisor. Students are normally given two terms to remove their deficit points; however, students who do not satisfy the conditions of the first term of probation may be dismissed from the department. Back to Top Critical Tracking Critical Tracking records each student’s progress in courses that are required for entry to each major. Please note the critical-tracking requirements below on a per-semester basis. Equivalent critical-tracking courses as determined by the State of Florida Common Course Prerequisites may be used for transfer students. Semester 1 Complete 1 of 7 critical-tracking courses with a minimum grade of C within two attempts: CHM 2045 or CHM 2095, MAC 2311, MAC 2312, MAC 2313, COP 3502, PHY 2048, PHY 2049 2.5 GPA required for all critical-tracking courses 2.0 UF GPA required Semester 2 Complete 1 additional critical-tracking course with a minimum grade of C within two attempts 2.5 GPA required for all critical-tracking courses 2.0 UF GPA required Semester 3 Complete 2 additional critical-tracking courses with minimum grades of C within two attempts 2.5 GPA required for all critical-tracking courses 2.0 UF GPA required Semester 4 Complete 2 additional critical-tracking courses with minimum grades of C within two attempts 2.5 GPA required for all critical-tracking courses 2.0 UF GPA required Semester 5 Complete all 7 critical-tracking courses with minimum grades of C in each course within two attempts 2.5 GPA required for all critical-tracking courses 2.0 UF GPA required Back to Top Model Semester Plan Students are expected to complete the general education international (GE-N) and diversity (GE-D) requirements. This is often done concurrently with another general education requirement (typically, GE-C, H or S). To remain on track, students must complete the appropriate critical-tracking courses, which appear in bold. These courses must be completed by the terms as listed above in the Critical Tracking criteria. This semester plan represents an example progression through the major. Actual courses and course order may be different depending on the student's academic record and scheduling availability of courses. Prerequisites still apply.
