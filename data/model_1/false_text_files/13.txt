Starting Autumn 2017 all students must complete: Apply to CSS Program Calculus 2 (TMATH 125) or equivalent as an admission requirement. To ease the transition to the changed admission requirements, and to respect the 2 year advance notice agreement with community colleges, until the end of 2018, the admission requirement of TMATH 125 is a provisional requirement, meaning that students can complete it once they are already admitted to the major. That means that all transfer students who were eligible for admission based on the old requirements are still eligible according to the new requirements during the 2 year advance notice period. Starting in Winter 2019, TMATH 125 will become a conditional requirement for admission, meaning that this course has to be completed before admission to the major. All students who have been admitted to the program before Autumn 2017 will follow the old requirements. To aid in the transition period all students can check the curriculum page to find what courses you will need to finish in order to graduate depending on your admittance. You are also encouraged to contact or schedule an appointment with our advisors so they can clear up any confusion you may have.
