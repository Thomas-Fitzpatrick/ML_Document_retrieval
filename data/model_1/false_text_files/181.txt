Career Opportunities Graduates of the BSc in Computer Science & Information Technology are highly skilled and are equipped to take on employment as professional engineers, designers and consultants in a range of organisations, specialising in areas such as software design and development, digital media and games, IT consultancy, telecommunications and medical informatics. Career prospects for IT/computing graduates are very strong in Ireland and throughout the world. The government’s Expert Group on Future Skill Needs has highlighted a shortfall in the number of IT/computing graduates as the number of students studying IT/computing is not adequate to meet the demands in virtually every sector.

Through the course I was challenged to think creatively to solve problems and discovered how systems that are incorporated into everyday life work. I also met many people who shared similar interests and we were able to incorporate these into various class group projects which included music, computer games and artificial intelligence. The degree has led me to postgraduate research in artificial intelligence in NUI Galway. in Connect with Alan Downloads Undergraduate Prospectus 2018 PDF (12.3 MB) Quick Guide to Courses PDF (989 KB) A Level Quick Guide PDF (408 KB) CAO Brochure PDF (1.3 MB) Postgraduate Taught Prospectus 2018 PDF (7.2 MB) Postgraduate Research Prospectus 2018 PDF (4.6 MB) International Prospectus 2016 PDF (3.6 MB) About NUI Galway Founded in 1845, we've been inspiring students for 170 years.
