As intelligent, innovative and forward-thinking people continue to develop technology, it can help us to solve problems in a great range of applications (e.g. traffic circulation, climate modeling, the study of diseases, systems engineering, business modeling and ecology). This degree prepares you for a career in computing and information technology. It gives you in-depth knowledge of software engineering and the practical skills to apply this knowledge to develop the technology behind computer games, mobile phones, the Internet, web applications, entertainment systems and many other computing-based products. Why do this course? The BSc in Computer Applications is Ireland’s most popular computing degree Computing technology is and will remain all around us in our everyday lives. Obtain in-depth knowledge of software engineering and the practical skills to apply this knowledge. Gain experience with six months paid INTRA work placement. Graduates work in some of today’s most innovative and exciting fields, such as computer games, graphics, robotics, mobile computing and electronic commerce. Your skills will be recognised and valued the world over. Student Voice "Computer Applications has a lot of continuous assessments so you can often pass the module before you sit an exam, which is really helpful.  It takes a lot of stress off" There is a maths learning centre on campus and if you are struggling at all, they will help you" "It's a really exciting time to be studying Computer Applications.  There are lots of employment opportunities out there and lots of companies looking for someone like me" Ciara McAuley, Computer Applications. Learn more about this course → Arrange to talk to a member of the DCU team. About the course Your first year of the Computer Applications course will be devoted to gaining a strong competence in computer programming and to acquiring essential mathematical skills. In subsequent years, specialisms in software engineering will equip you with the necessary skills to create software and innovative ways of using it. Examples include web applications, computer games, mobile applications and the software that is contained in the devices we use on a daily basis (e.g. mobile phones, entertainment systems and cars). In Year Three, you’ll have the opportunity to spend six months on paid work placement. The INTRA programme integrates academic study with closely related jobs and will help you to stand out in the graduate employment market. You’ll complete major projects in Years Three and Four. These projects provide an opportunity for you to put into practice the software development techniques studied in class. An annual display of the final-year students’ work will allow you to showcase your talents to the industrial and business communities. It also allows potential employers to experience the high standard and broad range of the development work carried out by you on the course. This is very popular with industry and draws many prospective employers keen to hire DCU graduates.
