The Massey University Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics and Computer Engineering) will help you become an excellent electronic and computer engineer. You will be multi-disciplinary, have excellent practical skills and be able to design, develop and manage both software and hardware projects. You will be capable of working in a team environment to solve problems from the device level to networks, communication systems and embedded systems. Electronic systems sense what is happening in the world around us, and computer systems process this data to extract information, or to control some activity. Virtually every aspect of our lives involves electronic and computer technology. Electronic systems sense what is happening in the world around us, and computer systems process this data to extract information, or to control some activity.Tablet computers, smart phones and internet banking are commonplace today - the obvious examples of electronics and computers in modern day life. However, most electronics and computer systems are hidden: in appliances from toasters to washing machines to refrigerators; in cars; in traffic systems; in heating systems. These are just a few examples of how electronics and computers have integrated and become all pervasive in modern day life, ensuring the continued relevance of this area of engineering.Hands-on practice as you learnThe distinctive feature of the engineering course at Massey is that much of our teaching is based in the laboratory where you get real hands-on practice. There is also a strong emphasis on embedding computing & electronics technologies in every-day consumer products and the importance of the user interface.Highly-sought-afterMassey engineering graduates are sought-after by employers for their ability to be valuable employees from Day One.Earn moreA Ministry of Education report, undertaken over nine years, showed that those who complete a qualification in a science, technology, engineering or mathematics field of study have high relative earnings after they complete their study. Earnings can be substantially more than other graduates. Engineering and building-related fields have the largest earnings premiums over the national median of young graduates.

Hayden Short Bachelor of Engineering (Electronics and Computer Engineering) Graduated in 2012 Telecommunications Technician - Downer Group “Massey University’s engineering degree has enabled to get to amazing places like Antarctica to work and achieve my goals anywhere in the world…” I am working for Downer Group as the telecommunication technician at Scott Base, Antarctica. This role is a 13-month winter over role. I maintain all of the communications systems for the base. This includes the satellite link with New Zealand, the fibre network, the PABX telephone system, UHF, VHF, and HF radio systems for field communications, satellite phones and solar charging systems. In addition I develop solutions for field events that require interfacing with specialist equipment for scientific research. Since leaving Massey I have worked with point-to-point microwave radio systems, IT software and hardware systems including networking, and design and development of custom electronics solutions. Massey University’s engineering degree has enabled to get to amazing places like Antarctica to work and achieve my goals anywhere in the world. It gave me a solid understanding of telecommunications and electronics and helped me to develop methodical fault finding and analysis skills that are invaluable in my day to day work life. Careers What might your career look like?As an electronics and computer engineering graduate you will be as much at home designing an electronic or embedded hardware system as working on a large scale distributed software application. There are well-defined career structures within computing and electronics, leading to senior specialist positions and a variety of management positions including project leader, programming manager, systems manager, or more general management.Examples include:Electronic engineering sectorsSystems management/programmer/analystAll software sectorsInformation technology sectors from research and development to serviceSought after by employersYou will gain a broad range of skills and practice as well as strong analytical and critical thinking skills.
