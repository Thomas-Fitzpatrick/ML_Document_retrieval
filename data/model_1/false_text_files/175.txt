While theories are the focus of the autumn and spring terms, the summer term leans towards enhancing hand-on skills through student placements, internships and course design, and smaller cross-disciplinary optional modules. Also available in the summer term are high-level lectures and seminars given by distinguished professors from the university and visiting scholars from other universities at home and abroad. The trimester system brings our education in line with that of first-class domestic and overseas universities and enables better sharing of educational resources. In the summer term and the summer vacation, students can pay academic visits to other universities. Similarly, the faculty can make full use of this period to participate in academic exchange and cooperation programs with Chinese and foreign colleagues tailored to their teaching and research needs. Dalian University of Technology offers 87 undergraduate programs, 71 of which are based on the main campus in Dalian and 16 of which on the Panjin campus. These programs cover a wide range of subjects including engineering, economics, management, language and literature, law, philosophy, arts, education and medicine. The University is home to 23 national level key majors, 42 pilot majors of National Comprehensive Reform, and 16 pilot majors under the Plan for Educating and Training Outstanding Engineers verified by the Ministry of Education. 20 programs have been assessed and accredited by China Engineering Education Professional Certification Association, and 43 programs have been reviewed under the criteria of the Comprehensive Assessment of Undergraduate Programs in Liaoning Province, with 21 majors ranking the first in the province.
