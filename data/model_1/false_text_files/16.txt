As space permits, students may elect any approved major program for which they have met the stated prerequisites. Major departments and/or committees may require auditions, placement examinations, proposals, specified courses, and/or grade-point averages to determine whether students are qualified for specific courses or for entrance into or continuation in a major. Students who fail to attain a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in work in their major may, at the option of the major department or committee, be denied the privilege of continuing in that major. Students in the College of Engineering and the College of Letters and Science normally must complete the major requirements in effect at the time they declare their major, though they may petition to follow a subsequent set of requirements. Changes in major requirements that increase the number or distribution of courses required normally will not be applied to students continuing in such majors provided there is no significant break in enrollment. {1} ##LOC[OK]## {1} ##LOC[OK]## ##LOC[Cancel]## {1} ##LOC[OK]## ##LOC[Cancel]## All provisions herein are subject to change without notice.
