The discipline combines principles of computer science with the rigour and problem-solving skills of engineering. If you are interested in computer programming, technical design and solving complex problems, then software engineering may be for you. Explore your options Your engineering degree features common units in the first year that combine broad foundation principles with a wide range of major choices, giving you flexibility and options before you choose your career specialisation. Why choose this course? This unique course will provide you with a background in electrical engineering with an embedded systems specialisation, along with software design and implementation skills. You will learn about the central role of software in the modern world—in banking and finance, government, education, transportation, entertainment, science, medicine and law. You will also learn about the many applications of software that are safety critical or involve large and expensive systems that have major impact on people's lives, livelihoods and the economy, and that the effectiveness of these applications depends on the skills of software engineers. Our engineering courses, whether a single or double degree, now include honours-level content integrated throughout the course. A bachelor honours degree is a higher-level qualification than a bachelor degree; and along with the advanced knowledge and skills, it will benefit you in your professional career, or future research and study. The duration of the degree remains unchanged: a single engineering honours degree is a four-year program, and a double degree is five years. Professional recognition This course has professional accreditation from Engineers Australia (EA) and the Australian Computer Society (ACS). EA is a signatory to the Washington Accord, and ACS is a signatory to the Seoul Accord, which permits graduates to work in various countries across the world. This course is recognised internationally in the engineering profession, giving our graduates more career opportunities overseas. Work Integrated Learning Work Integrated Learning (WIL) is embedded in the curriculum and it is a core component for all engineering students. WIL allows you to graduate with a portfolio of professional skills that provides evidence of your professional competencies. You are required to undertake 60 days of approved work experience in the engineering environment as part of your work integrated learning.
