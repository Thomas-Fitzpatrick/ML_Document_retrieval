Name: Allison Rowe Major: Mechanical Engineering Minors/Certificates: English Year: Sophomore Hometown: Mequon, Wisconsin What is one piece of advice you would give to an incoming freshman? It’s all about quality over quantity - invest your time in a few organizations that you can get really involved in, find strong and lasting friendships, and make some amazing memories. What organizations outside the college of engineering do you belong to? Greek Life, WiSE (Women in Science and Engineering) Have you had any international experience? If so, where did you go, for how long, and what did you do? Yes, I studied abroad in Ireland for six weeks the summer between my freshman and sophomore year.  I participated in a creative writing and Irish literature program, so I did a lot of writing while traveling around Ireland! How are you an "engineer ... and something more"? I am an engineer and a writer, and I love that Iowa has given me the chance to explore both my passions! I am also invested in Greek life and other organizations outside engineering. Have you done research with a professor? If so, what department was the professor in and what was your research about? Yes, I have conducted research for the past year with Professor Sarah Vigmostad.  She works in the Biomedical Engineering Department, specifically in Cardiovascular Biomechanics.  In our research, we have been analyzing the viability of cancer cells in response to fluid shear stress within the bloodstream. Is there something else you'd like to tell us about yourself? I am also a part of the Grand Challenge Scholars Program.  Through the program, I have been working on several different components of the challenge of “Engineering Better Medicines”.  I really like the program because it offers the opportunity to unite many parts of my college experience - research, interdisciplinary study, global experience, service learning, and entrepreneurship - under one central focus. What is your favorite part about being a student at The University of Iowa? Both my parents went to school here, so I have considered myself a Hawkeye for a long time.  But my favorite part about going to school here is that I have been able to make my experience entirely my own.  I have been able to pursue my passions, get involved, and make lots of amazing memories here at Iowa. Who is your favorite professor and why? I have really enjoyed class with Professor Kamran Samani.  He explains Thermodynamics in a way that is interesting and easy to understand.  He is also easy-going and funny, which definitely helps keep the class engaged. What has been your favorite course? My favorite courses have definitely been Thermodynamics and Engineering Problem Solving I.  They made me realize that I made the right decision in choosing engineering. What do you enjoy doing in your free time at The University of Iowa? During my free time, I play intramural volleyball with my friends or go to fun workout classes at the rec.  I also love exploring new restaurants and coffee shops or visiting some of the cute stores downtown.
