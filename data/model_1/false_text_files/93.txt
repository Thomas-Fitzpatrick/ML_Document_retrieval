Undergraduate students will read two majors chosen from among the disciplinary strengths of the four schools in the College, namely, the School of Humanities (SoH), the School of Social Sciences (SSS), the School of Art, Design and Media (ADM), and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information (WKWSCI). Unlike the existing single discipline-based degrees, the new BA degree will feature two distinct majors within an innovative new degree structure. As such this is a fully conceived double-disciplinary degree. Each major will represent approximately 42% of the overall degree, with the remaining 16% reserved for General Education courses. Students will be admitted into this new Double Major degree programme at the point of entry to NTU, and declare their two majors at this point. In keeping with the prevailing practice with HASS’s current single degree programmes, students may apply for a transfer of major after the first year if they wish.Why do a Double Major?The Double Major Degree will offer students the opportunity to specialise in any two major academic disciplines and will encourage a multidisciplinary educational and intellectual focus; it will equip students with the transferable skills of a liberal arts education for successful careers in the rapidly changing environment of the 21st century. Graduates from this programme will be suitable employees in both the public and private sectors in Singapore and beyond. Key combinations of disciplines will also facilitate comparative intellectual insights and nourish a mature capacity to engage different perspectives, research approaches, and interpretive strategies. The new BA programme will retain the strengths of the individual disciplines while developing an interdisciplinary focus that will educate graduates in a multi-skilled fashion. Students’ ability to develop transferable skills will be further enhanced in ways that will directly benefit an ever-changing social and employment landscape; when society experiences multidimensional transformations, human knowledge goes through rapid renewal, and employers of many kinds require creativity and innovation. Students will be better prepared for an increasingly multi-focused Singapore, and international, employment market. Pairings of diverse disciplines like Economics and Communications, Chinese and Communications, Psychology and Sociology, Philosophy and Public Policy, for example, may offer competitive advantages to students who intend to work in the media, community work and counselling, or in the Civil Service and in government research-policy units. Professions like teaching will also benefit by offering students two major teaching subjects, from disciplines like Chinese, Economics, English Literature, History or Linguistics, while new possible majors like Art History, or Geography, would add depth and range to existing Arts and Humanities disciplines. Of course, students who graduate with disciplinary depth in two disciplines are also very well positioned for postgraduate studies, where multidisciplinary approaches are increasingly defining higher learning. Academic Focus Students will elect two Majors from among the major disciplines in which the college currently has significant expertise. These include the following: School of Humanities- English Literature, and Linguistics and Multilingual Studies.. School of Social Sciences- Economics, Psychology, and Public Policy and Global Affairs. School of Art Design and Media- Art History Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information- Media AnalyticsAdditional majors that will be offered as part of this double major structure will be developed to meet the needs of Singapore’s employment market.
