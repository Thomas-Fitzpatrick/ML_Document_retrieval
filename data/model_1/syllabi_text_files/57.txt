Topics include: algorithms and problem solving; testing methodologies; fundamental aspects of a programming language including data types, input/output, simple selection and iteration control structures, data structures, one-dimensional arrays; and introduction to the concepts involved in object-oriented programming. Timetabled Learning Activities Lectures: 2 x 1 hour per week; computer laboratories: 1 x 3 hours per week (1 hour unsupervised); optional Peer Assisted Study Session (PASS): 1 hour per week. Unit Learning Experiences The approach to learning in this unit involves lectures that provide explanations of the theory and background to basic computer science concepts surrounding programming. These lectures are rich with examples, presented, where possible, interactively. These concepts are then put into practice during internal laboratory sessions where detailed interactive feedback is provided by tutors. External students are assigned a tutor with whom they can liaise directly via phone and email. External tutors will provide feedback and assistance to external students completing laboratory exercises. These laboratory sessions give students ample opportunity to develop those practical skills in both abstract problem solving and the expression of solutions within the constraints of syntactically defined language. Assignments represent the opportunity to solve a larger problem as part of a project and consider the broader context necessary when solving such problems. Assessment Using a formative approach, students complete weekly computer lab exercises (worth 30%) which provide an opportunity to develop practical expertise in the concepts covered in lectures. Feedback is provided interactively to internal students during the lab sessions and to external students via email and telephone. External students may submit their lab exercises on a weekly basis or collectively at intervals. Two assignments, worth 10% and 20%, assess the combination of multiple concepts at a high level and provide further opportunity for students to develop practical programming skills and demonstrate their understanding. Written assignment feedback is provided on the submitted work using a standard feedback form. The final examination assesses student achievement of unit learning outcomes. Prerequisites Nil.

All students, regardless of their location or mode of study, need to have access to and be able to use computing devices with browsing capability and a connection to the Internet via Broadband (Cable, ADSL or Mobile) or Wireless. The Internet connection should be readily available and allow large amounts of data to be streamed or downloaded (approximately 100MB per lecture recording). Students also need to be able to enter into online discussions and submit assignments online. Contacts Unit Coordinator No co-ordinators found for this unit.
