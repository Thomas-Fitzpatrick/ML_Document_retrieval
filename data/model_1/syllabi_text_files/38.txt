It provides an intuitive introduction to the concept of programming and covers basic programming constructs including comments, variables, assignment statements, control structures (selection, repetition), expressions, modularisation, input and output. This module provides a general introduction to computer programming focusing on the concepts of problem solving, basic programming constructs, and program design. It introduces how to design, write and test simple programs. Outline Of SyllabusProgramming Fundamentals – constructs - Basic syntax and semantics of a higher-level language - Variables, types, expressions, and assignment - Simple I/O - Conditional and iterative control structures - Methods and parameter passing - Structured decomposition Programming Fundamentals – problem solving - Problem-solving strategies - The role of algorithms in the problem-solving process - Implementation strategies for algorithms Programming Fundamentals – data structures - Representation of numeric data - Range, precision, and rounding errors - Arrays - Representation of character data - Strings and string processing Programming Languages – virtual machines - The concept of a virtual machine Teaching MethodsTeaching ActivitiesCategory Activity Number Length Student Hours Comment Scheduled Learning And Teaching ActivitiesLecture441:0044:00LecturesGuided Independent StudyAssessment preparation and completion12:002:00End of Semester examGuided Independent StudyAssessment preparation and completion440:3022:00Revision for end of semester examGuided Independent StudyAssessment preparation and completion441:0044:00Lecture follow-upScheduled Learning And Teaching ActivitiesPractical221:0022:00PracticalsScheduled Learning And Teaching ActivitiesSmall group teaching101:0010:00TutorialsGuided Independent StudyProject work221:0022:00CourseworkGuided Independent StudyIndependent study341:0034:00Background readingTotal200:00 Teaching Rationale And RelationshipLectures will be used to introduce the learning material and for demonstrating the key concepts by example. Students are expected to follow-up lectures within a few days by re-reading and annotating lecture notes to aid deep learning. Tutorials will be used to emphasise the learning material and its application to the solution of problems and exercises set as coursework, during which students will analyse problems as individuals and in teams. This is a very practical subject, and it is important that the learning materials are supported by hands-on opportunities provided by practical classes. Students are expected to spend time on coursework outside timetabled practical classes. Students aiming for 1st class marks are expected to widen their knowledge beyond the content of lecture notes through background reading. Students should set aside sufficient time to revise for the end of semester exam.

The heavy weighting of coursework (50%) in this module reflects the importance of practical aspects of this module. Study abroad students considering this module should contact the School to discuss its availability and assessment. N.B. This module has both “Exam Assessment” and “Other Assessment” (e.g. coursework). If the total mark for either assessment falls below 35%, the maximum mark returned for the module will normally be 35%.
