It begins with the development of problem solving skills relevant to the solution of programming problems. This subject is one of the foundation subjects for other studies in Information Technology because it develops skills, techniques and approaches that underpin many other areas of the computing discipline.+ Subject Availability Modes and Location Session 1OnlineBathurst CampusOn CampusAlbury-Wodonga CampusOn CampusBathurst CampusOn CampusCSU Study Centre MelbourneOn CampusCSU Study Centre SydneyOn CampusWagga Wagga CampusSession 2OnlineAlbury-Wodonga CampusOn CampusCSU Study Centre SydneySession 3On CampusCSU Study Centre Sydney Continuing students should consult the SAL for current offering details: ITC106 Where differences exist between the Handbook and the SAL, the SAL should be taken as containing the correct subject offering details.
