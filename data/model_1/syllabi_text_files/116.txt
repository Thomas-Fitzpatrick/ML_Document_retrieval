Learning aims & outcomes The aims of this module are: To introduce the essential skills of Programming, and the concepts of object-oriented Programming. To introduce techniques for good design of user interfaces for applications. To provide practice in applying these techniques to user interface design in Java. To develop practical skills in writing programs, including working with appropriate tools. On successful completion of this module, students will: Demonstrate understanding of the concepts of object-oriented programming; Develop general problem-solving skills; Be able to write programs using a number of core language features: assignments, methods, conditional and loop statements, classes, array, list and map data structures. Be able to construct well-designed applications in Java, using Human-Computer Interaction design principles. SyllabusThe module will cover topics from the following:1. Fundamentals of programming Numeric data; assignments; reading input; strings Conditional statements Loop statements Data structures: arrays, lists. 2. Object oriented software development Designing objects; modelling real-world entities Classes and inheritance; interfaces Class diagram notation 3. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) Java concepts for GUI programming. HCI and user interface design: HCI design principles. User interface architectures. Layout management concepts. Interaction styles. Dialog design. Task analysis. GOMS. 4. Advanced programming concepts Exceptions Regular Expressions. 5. Application programming Code organisation: packages. Reasoning about programs: problem solving. Usability. Software development support tools: IDEs, Version Control.
