Students will learn to develop and debug simple programs using basic programming concepts (assignments, if statements, loops, methods); data types (scalars, arrays, arraylists); and basic object-oriented programming concepts (objects and classes). They will also learn to write programs to a professional standard - programs that both work and are accessible and maintainable by other professional programmers. The module will place less emphasis on traditional lectures - there be one per week - and instead (a) more time will be spent in laboratories gaining hand-on experience; and (b) material will be available both in the form of extensive written notes and short screen capture videos, explaining and demonstrating tools, concepts and their applications.NotesUpdated Nov 2016. Available to visiting and exchange students.SyllabusWhat is a program? Examples of programming languages.Introduction to Programming in Java. The Java programming environment and tools for writing Java programs.Declaring and Using Variables and Assignments.Primitive data types, arithmetical operations, precedence and expressions.Input/Output: Input from Keyboard; Output to Screen; Checking input for correctness and security.Decisions: principles of decision-making and conditional statements in programming, if statements, if-else statement, switches, comparing numbers and strings.Iteration: principles of loop structures and termination/continuation conditions in programming, for loops, while loops and do loops, nested loops.Collection Data Types: Arrays and Arraylists.Common algorithms on arrays.Program design techniques, modularisation and methods, parameters and parameter passing.Object Oriented Programming: basic principles and design, classes and objects.Principles and good practice for program engineering: structure, documentation, security, readability, coding conventions and standards, maintenance, testing (this theme will run through the module).DeliveryOn Campus LecturesContact Hours40 (10 lectures, 30 laboratory)Learning Outcomes- Students will be able to design programs to solve specific problems based on procedural programming concepts, and the object oriented programming concepts of classes, objects, methods and encapsulation.- Students will be able to write and debug programs to solve specific problems based on procedural programming concepts, and the object oriented programming concepts of classes, objects, methods and encapsulation.- Students will be able to write programs that meet professional standards in terms of readability and the programming conventions of Java.- Students will be able to read and describe the function of straightforward programs based on procedural programming concepts, and the object oriented programming concepts of classes, objects, methods and encapsulation written by others.
