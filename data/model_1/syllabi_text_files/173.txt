Students will learn how to make many simple things happen and how to solve simple problems by programming. After taking the course the students should be able to: understand the basic ideas of programming and be familiar with variables, arrays, strings, conditionals, loops, terminal and file I/O, functions, etc.; confidently write computer programs in the language they have learned during the course; run programs, to produce results. Learning Outcomes After taking the course the students should be able to: understand the basic ideas of programming and write small programs that demonstarte their knowledge of variables, loops, I/O, etc.; confidently write computer programs in the language they have learned during the course (e.g. C); run programs, to produce results.
