Some core concepts covered in COMP10110 will be revisited through new examples and applications. Other topics covered include, program design, recursive functions, enumerations, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, file processing, structures, linked list and multi-dimensional arrays. Examples and concepts are typically presented in C. The main concepts of Object Oriented Programming will be introduced using C++. A strong emphasis is placed on the development of practical programming skills for building software applications to solve real problems. The course is designed to give a sound understanding of programming techniques, and how to get your application programs from the design phase to implementation. Learning Outcomes On completeing this module, the students will be able to - Design programming solutions to solve problems- Write programs which use multiple forms of input and output- Write programs which dynamically allocate memory as required- Use data structures and recursion when writing computer programs- Appreciate the core concepts of Object Oriented Programming Associated Programmes Currently unavailable Workload  Hrs/Semester Lectures24 Practical48 Autonomous Student Learning55 Total Workload 127 Assessment Strategies Description% of Final GradeTiming Practical Assignments20Thr_Sem Continuous Assessment40Thr_Sem Final Exam40End_Sem_Exam_2 What happens if I fail?
