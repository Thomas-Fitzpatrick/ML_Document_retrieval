Learn how to design robust code, debug to identify errors and test to ensure design requirements are met.Objectives On completion of this module, students should be able to:-Develop an algorithmic solution to a problem-Design and implement a simple procedural program that embodies an algorithm-Understand data input/output and how programs make use of persistent storage-Test and debug programs in a systematic way Learning outcomesOn completion of the year/programme students should have provided evidence of being able to:- demonstrate a familiarity with the basic concepts, information, practical competencies and techniques which are standard features of the discipline;- be able to communicate the results of their work;- present a structured and coherent simple argument;- be able to interpret and evaluate the underlying concepts and principles of the discipline;- demonstrate an ability to evaluate the appropriateness of different approaches to problem solving associated with the discipline;- appreciate their strengths and weaknesses as learners;- demonstrate computational thinking including its relevance to everyday life;- operate computing equipment effectively, taking into account its logical and physical properties.Skills outcomesComputational thinkingProgrammingSyllabus-Concept and properties of algorithms-Role of algorithms in the problem-solving process-Programming language syntax and semantics-Program compilation-Concept of a data type-Goals and limitations of static typing-Variables and primitive data types-Expressions and assignments-Console and file I/O-Conditional and iterative control structures-Functions and parameter passing-Concept of recursion-Arrays-Compound data types-Strings and string processing-Testing and debugging techniques Teaching methodsDelivery typeNumberLength hoursStudent hoursLaboratory102.0020.00Lecture201.0020.00Private study hours60.00Total Contact hours40.00Total hours (100hr per 10 credits)100.00Opportunities for Formative FeedbackCoursework assignments, in-class validation tests Methods of assessmentCourseworkAssessment typeNotes% of formal assessmentAssignmentCoursework30.00AssignmentCoursework30.00AssignmentCoursework40.00Total percentage (Assessment Coursework)100.00Resits will be assessed by the same methodology as the first attempt, unless otherwise stated.Reading listThe reading list is available from the Library websiteLast updated: 01/03/2017 DisclaimerBrowse Other CataloguesUndergraduate module catalogueTaught Postgraduate module catalogueUndergraduate programme catalogueTaught Postgraduate programme catalogueErrors, omissions, failed links etc should be notified to the Catalogue Team.PROD Terms and conditions Accessibility Privacy Freedom of information Â© Copyright Leeds 2013
