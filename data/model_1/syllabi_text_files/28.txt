(2H, 2L, 3C) Prerequisites: some programming experience Recent Offerings: Fall 2016 Summer 2016 Spring 2016 Fall 2009 - Fall 2015 Note: Many of our courses in the past have used the Moodle CMS. Moodle is an open source course management system (CMS) which we have adapted to support particular needs of Computer Science students. If a link to a recent offering takes you to Canvas or Moodle, just login with your VT PID, and visit the particular course of interest. In some moodle courses you can access them as "guest" and in others, you can simply "enroll" in the course website. In either case, you should be able to see labs, handouts, slides, projects, etc. for our courses. Computer Science is fun!
