in Time' plus some additional material.AimsBuilding on COMP16121, this course unit continues the theme of Object Oriented Design and Programming. The remaining core features of the language will be covered and some library packages will be introduced. Design principles for human-computer interfaces will also be taught.Program design will be addressed by the use of a number of case studies in which larger programs will be developed from informal requirements expressed in English and this development will include the process identifying objects, classes and methods.A practical introduction to team-working will be achieved through the mini-project that runs throughout the course unit.SyllabusInheritance, polymorphism and collections (8)More on GUIs (2)Recursion and recursive datatypes (8)Principles of HCI (4)Advanced case studies (10)Revision (2)Teaching methodsLectures34 in total (alternately 4 then 2 per week)Examples classesTutorial: 8 PASS + 8 with personal tutorLaboratoriesOffline: 5 (1 per fortnight) Online: 30 hours in total, 15 2-hour sessions including group mini-project.Feedback methodsExtensive face to face marking and feedback of laboratory work, allowing students to discuss their work, rather than the feedback being only one-way.Study hours Assessment written exam (2 hours)Lectures (36 hours)Practical classes & workshops (36 hours)Employability skillsAnalytical skillsInnovation/creativityProblem solvingLearning outcomesProgramme outcomeUnit learning outcomesAssessment A2Have a clear understanding of more advanced principles of the Java programming language.Examination B1 B2 B3 C5 D4 D5Be able to design, code and test Java programs, which meet requirements expressed in English.ExaminationLab assessment A2Have a basic understanding of principles that govern human performance when using computers and be able to apply such principles in a Java context.ExaminationLab assessment A2 C4Be able to understand the documentation for, and make use of, the Java API.Lab assessment D3 D4 D5Be able to work effectively as a member of a small group working on a non-trivial programming task.Lab assessmentReading listTitleAuthorISBNPublisherYearCoreJava: just in timeLatham, John9781848900257College Publications2010âœ”Additional notesCourse unit materialsLinks to course unit teaching materials can be found on the School of Computer Science website for current students.Links related to COMP16212Java: Just in Time - core text.
