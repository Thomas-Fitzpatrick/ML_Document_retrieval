More About The Course Introduction to Computer Science for Science, Mathematics, and Engineering I will familiarize students with the basic concepts underlying computer programming using the powerful and widely used programming language, C++. Students will get an introduction to computers and programming, understand variables, input & output, arithmetic and logic expressions, packaging data as strings and vectors, as well as the construction, testing and debugging of programs.Working with a unique, custom developed interactive platform created specifically for this course, students will experiment and explore using interactive tools and animated simulations, and be able to submit homework through an integrated online homework system that provides immediate feedback. By designing non-trivial programs, students will learn to solve basic problems and learn to use the tools of the trade.Students majoring in computer science, engineering and science can take this course to fulfill a computer science requirement. Business majors and professionals looking to get experience in programming and C++ will also benefit from this course.
