Suitable both for students who do not intend to major in Computer Science, and as preparation for COMP 160. Have you ever wanted to learn how to program a computer without being thrown in at the deep end? This paper gives a gentle introduction to programming in a language called Python, which was designed to be easy to use (the name comes from the humorous TV series Monty Python's Flying Circus, so you can tell that using Python is meant to be fun). Python is increasingly popular for both science and business applications. As a result, this paper is not only a good way to prepare for COMP 160, but also an ideal way to learn the basics of programming if you don't plan to major in Computer Science.

These skills are cumulative in the sense that mastering skills further on in the material requires that you've fully mastered prior skills. Therefore, the structure of COMP 150 is based on a mastery model. In this model, students progress at their own pace and move on to the next topic only when they've mastered the previous topic. As a consequence, COMP 150 does not follow the single-paced lecture/laboratory model of other papers. Assessment:There are eight mastery progressions and two practical tests. The progressions are worth 60% in total, and the practical tests are worth 20% each.The progressions are pass/fail. You cannot sit the next progression until you successfully complete the previous one. You can re-sit the progressions as many times as you like, but only once per day. If you pass a progression, you get all the marks available for that progression. If you fail a progression, you don't get any marks (but you can re-sit until you pass). Teaching Arrangements There is one lecture per week.There are two laboratory sessions each week, each two hours long.The laboratories have 24/7 access. Course material is made available on Blackboard. Textbooks The handbook is all that is required. It is available for free download or can be printed at cost.
