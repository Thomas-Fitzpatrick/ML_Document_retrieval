Implementation of solutions will be in Processing and Java using the Processing (www.processing.org) IDE. The goal is to learn fundamental programming concepts using 2D games and media as project assignments. The course will start with using the Scratch (www.scratch.mit.edu) environment to quickly learn fundamental concepts. Course Meeting Times The lecture is held in JGH 316 on Tue/Thu from 10:00 PM to 11:50. Required Resources Laptop (Mac or Windows) that can run Processing Install Processing ( www.processing.org ) Install Scratch ( www.scratch.mit.edu ) Textbook: There is no required book, there will be notes online, but the first book will be very useful. In fact, we will cite optional reading chapters from the book. The second book is more a more art/design oriented treatment of Processing, but it is filled with great stuff! If you buy none, you should be fine, if you buy one, we recommend it be "Learning Processing" for this course, and if you can afford both, they are both great books. Learning Processing, by Daniel Shiffman. Available at amazon.com and ebooks.com, and you should be able to order at Barnes and Noble type places too. Processing. A programming Handbook for Visual Designers and Artists by Casey Reas and Ben Fry. Available at amazon.com , and you should be able to order at Barnes and Noble type places too. Grading projects 35% (5, 6, 8, 8, and 8% respectively for assignments 1 - 5) in-class labs (can drop 2) 15% midterm 25% final 25% Final Exam The final is scheduled by the University for Saturday Nov w1, 10:00 - 11:50 AM. There are no exceptions to this time, plan any travel for AFTER the final. Late Assignments You are granted two "grace period" for the quarter. You can trade in the "grace period" for a 48 hour extension on a project, not a lab. After your grace period is used you must turn in what you have, finished or not. The idea is that work builds on previous assignments, hence, we are not allowing you to fall behind. {\bf NOTE, you can NOT use your grace period on the final project.} demo the project in class with everyone else.} Missed Labs Your lab grade is calculated based on the labs you do in class the day they are assigned. There is no outside makeup of labs. Labs are graded at the end of the hour as {0, 50%, or 100%}. You will be allowed to miss two labs without penalty, after those two misses are used up you can NOT make up labs. The two free miss days are intended to accommodate illness, necessary trips, snowboarding, sleep, whatever! Collaboration and Academic Honesty You will be working in grops of two. The basic presumption is that the work you hand in was done by you two, and ONLY you two. Occasionally on your programs (but never on exams!), it may be necessary to ask someone for help. You are permitted to do so, provided you meet the following two conditions. You specifically acknowledge the help on the work you hand in. You understand the work that you hand in, so that you could explain the reasoning behind the parts of the work done for you by another. Note, exams will test this knowledge also, so it is in your best interest to fully understand the problem. We shall not deduct credit for small amounts of acknowledged assistance. Such shared interest can be beneficial to all concerned. We do reserve the right to give less than full credit in circumstances where it appears that there has been large-scale division of labor, and you are not getting as much learning out of the assignment as you should. Unacknowledged help will be deemed as cheating and will result in a grade of F for the course and cheaters will be brought to the attention of the Dean. Cheating on an exam will be result in a grade of F for the course and cheaters will be brought to the attention of the Dean.
