Software pervades many aspects of most professional fields and sciences, and an understanding of the development of software applications is useful as a basis for many disciplines. This module covers the development of simple software systems. Students will gain an understanding of the software development process, and learn to design and implement applications in a popular object-oriented programming language. Fundamentals of classes and objects are introduced, and key features of class descriptions: constructors, methods and fields. Method implementation through assignment, selection control structures, iterative control structures and other statements is introduced. Collection objects are also covered and the availability of library classes as building blocks. Throughout the course, the quality of class design and the need for a professional approach to software development is emphasized Details This module appears in: Computing Stage 1 Canterbury Computing Stage 1 Medway Humanities Undergraduate Stage 1 Humanities Undergraduate Stage 2 & 3 Short-Term Study Social Sciences Undergraduate Stage 1 Social Sciences Undergraduate Stage 2 & 3 STMS Undergraduate Stage 1 Contact hours 22 Lectures, 11 two hour classes Availability CO320 is delivered twice: once in the Autumn Term and repeated in the Spring Term.
