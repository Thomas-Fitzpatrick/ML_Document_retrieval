The emphasis is on writing succinct and elegant code, without being bogged down in the syntax and semantics of a conventional procedural or object-oriented language. The course is taught using a problem-solving approach with students being encouraged to use the various language features to solve well-specified problems and to explore some fundamental algorithms and data structures in computer science. Learning outcomes Knowledge and Understanding To recall the syntax and semantics of the Haskell language To explain the key features of functional programming languages: recursion, lazy evaluation, lists, higher-order functions To explain specific features of the Haskell language: partial application, data types, type classes and overloading, basic monadic I/O Intellectual Skills To design and implement functions for solving well-specified problems To define and implement data types for solving a given problem that are both efficient and well-suited to the problem To use the full range of Haskell’s language features to ensure succinct and elegant solutions to problems To compare different solutions to the same problem using basic complexity arguments To develop solutions for more open-ended problems where there is little or no guidance on design Practical Skills To use the available Haskell implementations (e.g. GHC, GHCi, Hugs) to implement and execute solutions to given problems To learn about and use any available supporting tools for program development, analysis, debugging etc. To use the supplied tools and frameworks for program testing and submission Module syllabus 1. Basics Expressions Built-in types Sequences List comprehensions 2. Functions Function types Rules, guards and where clauses Recursion Lazy evaluation Scope 3. List processing Constructors Polymorhism Functions over lists Examples from the Haskell prelude 4. Higher-order functions Higher-order functions over lists Currying and partial application 5. User-defined data types Polymorphic data types Recursive data types Trees 6. Type classes Overloading Class definitions and instances Inheritance 7. Introduction to I/O I/O actions Sequencing Monads ‘do’ notation Pre-requisites None, other than basic pre-university mathematics. Teaching methods Weekly lectures, catch-up tutorials, small-group tutorials, timetabled laboratory sessions, supervised catch-up laboratory sessions. There is also a series of optional lectures on Advanced Programming in Haskell. Assessments There is an unassessed practice test (formative assessment only), a 'driving test' (20%) and a final 'main test' (80%), all of which are taken in the laboratory under exam conditions using the Lexis test administration system. Students can also undertake independent self assessment through unassessed exercises, for which model answers are made available.
