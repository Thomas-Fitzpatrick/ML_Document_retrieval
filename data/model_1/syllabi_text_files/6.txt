Computer Science Course -- Univ. of Porto -- Computer Programming I Go backward to Introduction to ComputingGo up to Course Modules: aims, syllabi and bibliographyGo forward to Computer Programming II Computer Programming I Aims To introduce the students to the programming process using a multi-paradigm multi-language approach. In this course the students start by learning declarative programming principles: logic programming (Prolog) and functional programming (Gofer). Syllabus Logic Programming concepts: logical variables, facts, goals, rules, compound terms, lists, unification, backtracking, recursion, extra-logical predicates: negation, cuts and findall predicates. Prolog execution. Functional programming concepts: built-in types, functional decomposition, lists, strings, tuples, variables, simple pattern matching, guarded equations, recursion, lazy evaluation, infinite data structures, enumerated types, polymorphism, higher-order functions. Search methods: linear and binary search. Sort methods: bubble sort, insertion sort, merging sort and quick-sort. Bibliography R. Bird and P.
