Learning Outcomes After completing this module, students will be expected to be able to: 1.	Demonstrate an understanding of the basic principles and concepts that 			underlie the procedural programming model. 2.	Explain and make use of high-level programming language features that 			support control, data and procedural abstraction. 3.	Analyse and explain the behaviour of simple programs that incorporate 			standard control structures, parameterised functions, arrays, structures 			and I/O. 4.	Implement, test and debug simple programs that use the features listed 			above. Outline Syllabus Underlying principles of procedural programming -The imperative programming model; state, sequentiality and destructive assignment. -Abstraction: separating internal and external views; control, data and procedural abstraction. -A model of memory: variables; static and dynamic memory; the execution stack Programming in a high-level procedural language Identifiers and keywords Expressions and types: well-typed expressions; operator precedence and expression evaluation Statements and control flow: simple, compound and control statements; the assignment statement; selection and repetition Functions: definition, and call; local variables, scope and existence; parameters, formal and actual parameters, parameter passing Lists and dictionaries: declaration and initialisation; accessing elements Input and output: console and file I/O Teaching and Assessment Teaching Methods Lectures and Laboratories Assessment 50 per cent Coursework Mark, 50 per cent Exam Mark Coursework Progress Test worth 10% takes place in week 6; Exercise 1: Python Programming worth 20% submitted in week 7; Exercise 2: Python Programming worth 20% submitted in week 11.
