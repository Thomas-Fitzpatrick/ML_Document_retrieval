Aims, Objectives & Graduate Attributes 2.1 Course Aims This course focuses on the organising ideas of software design and construction. Because software systems are highly complex structures, special effort and techniques are needed to control that complexity and make them understandable by humans, not simply machines. Taking this course will teach you such techniques, which are common to good software engineering design, independent of the programming language, and include building abstractions to hide details, separating specification from implementation and establishing conventional interfaces to allow the creation of standard modules. Programming practice is necessary to the course, and you'll be using Python as it is well-suited to understanding fundamental computing ideas and practices. At course completion you will be able to analyse a problem and design and implement a computational solution to the problem. You will make use of three major programming paradigms: structured, object-oriented and event-driven. 2.2 Learning Objectives After successfully completing this course you should be able to: 1  apply program constructs such as variables, selection, iteration and sub-routines,2  apply basic object-oriented concepts such as classes, instances and methods,3  read and analyse code written by others,4  analyse a problem and design an algorithmic solution to the problem,5  read and analyse a design and be able to translate the design into a working program,6  apply techniques for testing and debugging,7  design and implement simple GUIs 2.3.
