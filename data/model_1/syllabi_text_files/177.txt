Module: Computing Programming I Module Specifications... Current Academic Year 2017 - 2018Please note that this information is subject to change. Module Title Computing Programming I Module Code CA116 School School of Computing Online Module Resources Module Co-ordinatorSemester 1: Stephen BlottSemester 2: Stephen BlottAutumn: Stephen BlottModule TeachersStephen Blott NFQ level 8 Credit Rating 10 Pre-requisite None Co-requisite None Compatibles None Incompatibles None Description This module introduces students to basic computer programming. Students will learn the fundamentals of computer programming, and how to write, run and debug their own programs. Students will also learn the fundamentals of computational problem solving. This module involves lectures and a significant amount of supervised laboratory work. Learning Outcomes 1. Master the basic techniques of programmatic problem solving.2. Write programs and run them from the command line.3. Recognise compiler and/or runtime errors and be able to resolve errors so discovered.4. Distinguish correct program behaviour from incorrect behaviour.5. Debug source code, locate errors and fix them.6. Master the following programming concepts: variables, control flow (if statements, for and while loops), functions and/or methods.7. Understand and be able to use arrays and strings.8. Implement basic programming idioms, such as linear search of an array.

For further information,students are advised to refer to the University's Marks and Standards and Programme Specific Regulations at: http://www.dcu.ie/registry/examinations/index.shtml Indicative Content and Learning Activities Python Programming FundamentalsWriting, running and debugging Python programs. Basic data types including numeric types, booleans and strings, the operations on those types, their operators and their precedence. Python arrays and tuples and their operations. Selection and Iteration. Defining and calling functions in Python Text-oriented input/output from standard input and to standard output.Problem SolvingComputational problem solving: translate programming problems from problem statement to functional solution/implementation. The use of Python arrays and tuples in algorithms and problem solving. Introductory algorithms, including linear search, binary search, insertion sort and selection sort. Iterative solutions to basic computational problems.Bucket ListStudents will be provided with a “bucket list” of computational problems to solve independently and at their own pace.  Solutions to these bucket list problems will contribute to each student’s continuous-assessment mark.ResourcesWith the amount of material available on-line, it is unnecessary to recommend a particular textbook. Students will be provided with detailed notes and references to third-party materials where appropriate.
