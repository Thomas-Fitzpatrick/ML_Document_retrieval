Many of the ideas and concepts are shared between different programming languages. In this module we will focus on Java 1.8. The programming language Java is an object-oriented language. The object-oriented concepts build the backbone of this module. Starting with the fundamental ideas of classes, attributes and methods we will develop many practical examples. Many ideas introduced in this modules will be extended on in the module on Data Structures and Development Environments. Throughout this module we will not only focus on the implementation but also on the design and design techniques of larger software products. Step by step we will use the UML notations and diagrams to represent and reason about different design options.
