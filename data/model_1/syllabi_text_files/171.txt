Academic Dishonesty Students are required to follow the University's Honor Code: "As a Jesuit institution committed to cura personalis- the care and education of the whole person- USF has an obligation to embody and foster the values of honesty and integrity. USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the Universityâs Honor Code. " You can find the full text of the code online at www.usfca.edu/fogcutter. This includes but is not limited to the following: ALL assignments are to be completed individually unless specified, in writing, on the assignment. Academic dishonesty will NOT be tolerated. This is your warning! Students are encouraged to meet with me if they have questions regarding assignments or this policy. Students caught cheating will face severe penalty. Students may: receive help from the professor and the TA. discuss the requirements of the assignments, the meaning of programs, or high-level algorithms with other students or outside sources. If you have any doubt with respect to what is acceptable to discuss, speak with the professor first. Students may NOT: look at another student's code. look at another student's solutions to homework problems. receive unapproved help from an outside source including a tutor or a family member. submit code which has, in whole or in part, been copied from any other source (including another student, a web page, or another text). submit solutions to problems which have, in whole or in part, been copied from any other source (including another student, a web page, or another text). Requirements Any help from a source other than the professor, the lab assistant, or a TA must be acknowledged. Example sources that must be cited are a parent, a family friend, and an outside tutor. If you wish to get a tutor in the course, speak with the professor. Any code submitted by a student must be completely original. No portion of a student's code may be copied from any other source (including, but not limited to, another student, a web page, or another text). Penalties Students caught violating the academic honesty policy will face severe penalty. A first offense will result in a zero on the assignment and a report to the Dean's office. A second offense will result in the student failing the course. © 2017 Alark Joshi. All rights reserved. Design by NodeThirtyThree + Free CSS Templates
