There are other books on C++ available online for free which are suitable for this course and could well be used as a replacement for the official course textbook. If you do not use the textbook, however, you will need to figure out which chapter in your references covers the subject. For example, when we discuss "pointers" this will not likely be in Chapter 10 of another book or even another edition of Savitch. The library has the textbook on reserve which can be found here. Lecture and Discussion Sections Lectures will present material from the course textbook, supplemented by additional subject matter. You are responsible for all material presented in all lectures. In discussion sections, your TA will review material covered in the lectures, present subject matter not covered in the lectures, discuss programming projects, and answer questions. Assignments Assignments are due at 9:00 PM on the dates listed below. Late submissions will NOT be accepted and will receive no credit.
