Whether you come to class or not, you are responsible for keeping up with what happens in class. If you miss a class (other than for illness or emergency), it is not reasonable for you to expect me to repeat the material that was covered in the class you missed just for you. This applies both the content of the class as well as the announcements about class policies, events, deadlines or whatever. The AUC attendance policy will be applied.
