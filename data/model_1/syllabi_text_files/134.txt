no previous experience of programming, and is based on the book 'Java Just in Time', which was written by the course leader, and was deliberately published by a not-for-profit publisher so the retail price is low. 		Using neither the confusing 'objects first' approach, nor the confidence destroying 'objects late' ordering, students are instead taken gently from their natural 'task oriented' view of problem solving, through the basics of programming and then soon onto objects. 		Every programming and Java concept is introduced, Just in Time, in the context of one of more than a hundred program examples, so motivation is never lacking. Even when objects are introduced, readers immediately see their benefit, and thus happily augment their 'task oriented' view with the 'object oriented' one. 		Programming skill, being at least 51% confidence, is built in manageable layers by undertaking over one hundred pieces of coursework. 		Other learning enhancing aspects include coffee time questions, end of chapter collected concepts, no use of non-standard library code, and independence of any confidence-entrapping learning environment.AimsThis course unit provides the first exposure to programming in the School's degree programmes and, for many students, their first encounter with programming at all. Its main aim, therefore, is to introduce the principles of design and programming, using objects as a basis. This course unit will use Java and provide an 'Objects-Soon' introduction to the Object-Oriented paradigm. Together with COMP16212, the emphasis is on acquiring best practice incrementally from the bottom-up, including use of modern development and documentation tools, approaches to testing programs for correctness and evaluating designs against typical non-functional characteristics, such as efficiency, maintainability and readability.SyllabusIntroduction (2) Essential basics: sequential execution and programming (2) types, variable and expressions (2) execution flow control (6) separate methods (2) separate classes (4) Object oriented design (2) Introduction to graphical user interfaces using SWING (4) Arrays (4) Files and Exceptions (4) In Conclusion (2)Teaching methodsLectures34 in total (alternately 4 then 2 per week)Laboratories5 (1 per fortnight)Feedback methodsExtensive face to face marking and feedback of laboratory work, allowing students to discuss their work, rather than the feedback being only one-way.Study hours Assessment written exam (2 hours)Lectures (33 hours)Practical classes & workshops (34 hours)Employability skillsAnalytical skillsInnovation/creativityProblem solvingLearning outcomesProgramme outcomeUnit learning outcomesAssessment A2Have a clear understanding of the basic principles of the Java programming language.Examination A2 C5 D4 D5Be able to design and code small Java programs, which meet simple requirements expressed in English.ExaminationLab assessment C5 D4 D5Be able to test and debug simple Java programs.Lab assessmentLab test online C5Be able to write informal justifications for the programs they design.
