Students shall not log in to the computers while the lecture/exam is in progress, as this may distract fellow students and the instructor. The only time students may use computers during the lecture is when the instructor specifically asks the students to do so for the purposes of demonstration of programs, etc. Exams will cover all lecture material. Exam coverage and topics will be notified well before the time of the exam. Exams must be taken on the hour they are scheduled. They will not be given early, and can be made up only if documented evidence of medical emergency or death in the family is presented before the time of the exam. Late Assignments: 10% penalty for 1-2 days late; 25% penalty for 3-4 days late; 40% penalty for 5 days late. Late assignments shall not be accepted once the solutions are discussed or posted on course web page. The lab teaching assistant will help with the labs portion of this class. Labs can be done in pairs. For more information on programming in pairs, visit the following link at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming . There are no group assignments in this course and the programs are expected to be your own. All work submitted for grading must be the student's own work. Plagiarism will result in a score of zero on the exam or assignment, and/or dismissal from the course. You can review the document on academic honesty policy in the student hand book, which is available from : http://www.marquette.edu/pages/home/resourcecommons/bulletin Attendance is vital to success in this class.
