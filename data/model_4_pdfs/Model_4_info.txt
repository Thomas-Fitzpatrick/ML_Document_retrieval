Random Forest, Bag of Words
This was part of some experiments to build a pdf-only classifier and to see how it would perform.
The sample set appeared to be too small to get a useful result however, so other areas were explored further.

This was testing the Non-PDF simple case, as described in Section 5.2 of my Report.
This run used the Random Forest classifier with the Bag of Words model.

Positive Set:
Non-PDF syllabi from summer work

Negative Set:
Non-PDF non-syllabi gathered by running the crawler without a classifier and selecting pages that weren't
syllabi.
