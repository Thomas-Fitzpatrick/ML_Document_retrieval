Support Vector Machine, Bag of Words

This was testing the PDF inclusive set, as described in Section 5.2 of my Report.
This run used the Support Vector Machine classifier with the Bag of Words model.

Positive Set:
Non-PDF and PDF syllabi from summer work

Negative Set:
Non-PDF and PDF non-syllabi gathered by running the crawler without a classifier and selecting pages that weren't
syllabi.
