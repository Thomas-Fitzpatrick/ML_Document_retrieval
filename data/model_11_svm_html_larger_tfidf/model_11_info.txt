Support Vector Machine, tf-idf

This was testing the Non-PDF simple case, as described in Section 5.2 of my Report.
In this particular example, I tried to extend the size of the negative set to see if a larger training
set would improve the performance of the SVM classifier. It didn't have any significant impact so
was omitted from the report.
This run used the Support Vector Machine classifier with the tf-idf model.

Positive Set:
Non-PDF syllabi from summer work

Negative Set:
Non-PDF non-syllabi gathered by running the crawler without a classifier and selecting pages that weren't
syllabi. Extended with extra manual examples.
