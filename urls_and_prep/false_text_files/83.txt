Our students advance the modern world by harnessing the power of electricity to build devices and systems, from nanoscale computer chips to multinational communications systems. Computer engineering reaches across both electrical engineering and computer science, and it involves designing, programming, and evaluating computer systems to continually improve performance and speed. These engineers may develop software, but more emphasis is placed on the interaction between a computer and the devices attached to it. Georgia Tech computer engineering graduates can find work in areas such as cybersecurity, robotics, wireless networks, and embedded systems.
