Start Here Industry News & Events Calendar Newsletter Archive Alumni & Community Computer-Integrated Surgery Minor The Whiting School of Engineering offers a minor in Computer Integrated Surgery (CIS) for full-time, undergraduate students at Johns Hopkins. The minor is particularly well suited for students interested in computer integrated surgery issues who are majoring in a variety of disciplines including biomedical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. The minor provides formal recognition of the depth and strength of a student‚Äôs knowledge of the concepts fundamental to CIS beyond the minimal requirements of his/her major. In order to minor in CIS, a student will require a minor advisor from the Engineering Research Center in Computer Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology (CISST ERC) in the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics. Current faculty members available as advisors include Professors Russell Taylor (CS), Greg Hager (CS), Jerry Prince (ECE), Ralph Etienne-Cummings (ECE), Louis Whitcomb (ME), Noah Cowan (ME), Marin Kobilarov (ME), Peter Kazanzides (CS), Iulian Iordachita (ME), and Emad Boctor (Radiology). If you are interested in declaring a CIS minor, please contact Alison Morrow. Requirements To satisfy the requirements for the minor in CIS, a student must have a fundamental background in computer programming and computer science, sufficient mathematical background, and also take a minimum of six courses (with a total of at least 18 credits, earning at least a C- in each course) directly related to concepts relevant to CIS. These six CIS courses must include two fundamental CIS core courses, which provide the student with the fundamental basis for CIS, and four approved upper-level courses (300-level or above) to allow the student to pursue an advanced CIS topic in depth.¬† The additional four upper-level courses must include at least one course designated as an ‚Äúimaging‚Äù course or one course designated as a ‚Äúrobotics‚Äù course, as discussed below. Required Fundamental Computer Science Courses EN.601.107 Intro Programming in Java EN.601.226 Data Structures 4 Or equivalent experience determined by your CIS minor advisor. Required Fundamental Mathematics Courses AS.110.106 Calculus I 4 or¬†AS.110.108 Calculus I AS.110.107 Calculus II (For Biological and Social Science) 4 or¬†AS.110.109 Calculus II (For Physical Sciences and Engineering) AS.110.202 Calculus III 4 or¬†AS.110.211 Honors Multivariable Calculus EN.553.291 Lin Alg & Diff Equations 4 or¬†AS.110.201 Linear Algebra or¬†AS.110.212 Honors Linear Algebra Required Fundamental Computer Integrated Surgery Courses EN.601.455 Computer Integrated Surgery I A design course in CIS. Either EN.601.456 Computer Integrated Surgery II or a design course in biomedical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, or mechanical engineering with substantial CIS content approved by the student‚Äôs faculty advisor in the CIS minor. Required Four Other Courses Related to CIS Students must also complete at least four other courses related to CIS.¬† Of these AT LEAST ONE must be in EITHER the Imaging Subgroup OR the Robotics Subgroup.

Minor Advising All students interested in the minor are required to make an appointment with Alison Morrow in the LCSR to be assigned to a minor advisor to receive guidance about the program. Phone: 410-516-4639 Email: alison.morrow@jhu.edu When possible, you will be assigned an advisor in your department (though this is not required). Students who decide to pursue the minor should also review their academic transcript with their minor advisor to ensure they will be able to complete the requirements. Fill out and submit an Add Minor form (which can be obtained from the registrar‚Äôs office) Complete the Requirements Checkout tables in the CheckOut sheet, downloadable on this web page. You should meet with your minor advisor periodically (at least once per year), bringing a copy of this form for review. During your senior year, you must also note the CIS Minor on your Application for Graduation. When all requirements have been completed, take the completed form to the CIS Minor Program Coordinator for review and signature.
