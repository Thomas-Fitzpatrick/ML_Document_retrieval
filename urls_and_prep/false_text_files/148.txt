B.S. in Computer Science | Undergraduate Course Catalog 2017-2018 Skip to main content Table of Contents Search Catalog Search for: B.S. in Computer Science College College of Arts and Sciences Department Computer Science Program Information Computer science is the systematic exploration of all aspects of computation. Computer science as a discipline seeks to build a scientific foundation for topics such as computer design, computer programming and software, information processing, algorithmic solutions to problems, and the algorithmic process itself. Computer science provides underpinnings for today’s applications in industry, science, government, and business and prepares the foundation for tomorrow’s applications in ubiquitous computing, medical cures for diseases, and instant access to information by everyone. The B.S. degree program in computer science provides preparation in the fundamental principles and processes of computation and training in applying these principles in application areas in industry, science, government, and business. The student completes a basic group of required courses in the early stages and chooses courses from several concentrations in the later stages to provide for appropriate breadth and depth of knowledge in the discipline. A B.S. degree in computer science provides a good foundation for advanced studies at the M.S. or Ph.D. level as well as for careers in industry, science, government, and business. To plan the major according to particular goals, students are encouraged to consult with an adviser in the department. Majors who are interested in having a paid work experience related to their area of study should contact the university’s Office of Cooperative Education, which coordinates the university’s cooperative education programs.
