Introduction to Programming×15 creditsAutumn Teaching, Year 1The module introduces you to a collection of basic programming concepts and techniques, including: designing testing debugging documenting programmes. The module introduces the programming language Java, and is for both absolute beginners and those with prior computing experience. Java is a language used for other components of undergraduate modules. It will be the primary language used for programming assignments in nearly all first year modules taught by the Department of Informatics.Mathematical Concepts×15 creditsAutumn Teaching, Year 1In this introductory mathematics module, you explore the fundamental mathematical concepts and skills needed for all Informatics degrees. You cover topics such as: basic set theory number systems regular expressions finite state automata functions basic calculus basic linear algebra proof by induction an introduction to the concepts of probability theory and statistics. Programming Concepts×15 creditsAutumn Teaching, Year 1In this module, you are introduced to algorithmic problem solving. Your studies in this module will answer the following questions: what is a problem specification, an algorithm, a computation? what are their properties? how does one develop an algorithm? how can one rigorously argue that an algorithm computes correct solutions to a given problem? how can one measure the efficiency of an algorithm and the complexity of a problem? As part of the module, you use a simple algorithmic language (pseudo code) for the sake of writing algorithms - the focus of this module is on algorithmic thinking, not coding. In the module, you specify and develop searching, sorting and other simple (and intuitive) algorithms. You apply and explore principles like divide-and-conquer and recursive programming. You also look at two important properties of algorithms - 'correctness' and 'complexity'. Algorithms should only compute correct solutions of a problem. To establish correctness, you are introduced to some relevant (propositional and predicate) logic, in an informal style (focusing on logical reasoning principles rather than logical calculi). Finally, you discuss asymptotic complexity classes and explore the concept of time complexity of an algorithm. As part of this module, you undertake exercise classes and coursework, based on a series of examples. The algorithms you develop in this module should be implemented in Java concurrently or at a later stage in the further programming module.Data Structures & Algorithms×15 creditsSpring Teaching, Year 1This module provides an introduction to data structures and algorithms for computer scientists. The module introduces a number of fundamental data structures, including arrays linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables and graphs. These are presented both abstractly, via the notion Abstract Data Types, and concretely in terms of their implementation in an object-oriented framework. The data structures are discussed and analysed in terms of efficiency of the basic operations they support and their application to program design problems. Consideration is given to important, fundamental algorithms for searching and sorting data.Further Programming×15 creditsSpring Teaching, Year 1This module follows on from "Introduction to Programming". It provides an introduction to more advanced programming concepts and techniques. You cover Java programming, including: use of subclasses and library classes to create well-organised programs choice and implementation of appropriate algorithms and data structures (e.g. arrays, lists, trees, graphs, depth- and breadth-first search, the minimax and A* algorithms) construction of graphical user interfaces for Java programs. Global Design Challenge×Spring Teaching, Year 1In this module you can participate in the Engineers without Borders (EwB) Challenge. Interdisciplinary teams of 5 or 6 students develop design solutions from project briefs provided by EwB. Project briefs address real-world, sustainable development projects proposed by EwB partner organisations, who are embedded in communities around the world. In this way, you are brought into contact with novel problems from real communities. You must consider both the technical and cultural dimensions of a design problem in arriving at an appropriate solution. The module is project-based with weekly, facilitated workshop sessions and further support from EwB UK. As part of the 'Challenge', teams attend dedicated, weekly 2 hour workshop classes. During these they are expected to work through a range of structured activities, including: initial choice of project brief appropriate research development of a design concept fulfilling the brief. Trained project mentors facilitate the workshops to help teams through the process, ensuring they meet progress goals. Assessment is based on a short, group presentation and group portfolio put together during the workshops. The best projects may be put forward to the national EwB Challenge final. The module is pass-fail and does not contribute to student credit.Introduction to Computer Systems×15 creditsSpring Teaching, Year 1In this module, you are introduced to three key aspects of computer systems – storage, processing and transmission of information.

Computer Science Project×45 creditsAutumn & Spring Teaching, Year 3This module will give you the opportunity to complete an extensive piece system design and implementation work under the supervision of a member of faculty. You will be able to chose from a range of project topics or offer a project of your own. All topics will require the application of skills and knowledge gained through previous modules of study and will you will be involved in the design and build of a technological solution to a computer science related problem (using programming, modelling, simulation tools as appropriate). Some project topics will be available in collaboration with commerce and industry, and will enable you to experience the methods and approaches of non-academic institutions. There will be no formal lectures to attend. The teaching methods used will simply be weekly individual/small-group meetings to discuss progress. The final year Computer Science projects should be viewed as the culmination of the degree – it gives you a chance to demonstrate all that you have learned. It will be the most demanding part of the undergraduate degree. It is very different from most other modules as although you will be supervised, you will have to work independently to a large extent. It will be your responsibility to define the problem boundaries, to investigate possible solutions, and to present the results verbally, in writing, and to demonstrate them in action. The results of the project will be submitted in two parts: a final report and the code of (the parts of) the produced system. You will be expected to give a presentation and demonstration of your work. The project report and presentation/demonstration are examined. To ensure that you are on the right track, you will need to submit an interim report that describes the early phase of your project, involving a debate on professional issues, requirements analysis, and planning. This interim report is also assessed.Limits of Computation×15 creditsSpring Teaching, Year 3This module is all about fundamental questions like 'what is computable?' and 'what is feasibly computable?'. The following topics are covered: what is a universal program? What is program specialisation? (partial evaluation, also known as s-m-n theorem). What is self-application? (boot-strapping). How can it be used to speed-up programs? How can an unsolvable problem be defined using WHILE? How can this be generalised? (Rice's theorem). Are there decidable but unfeasible problems? What are typical examples? What does feasible mean? How can one measure resource-usage of (time, space, non-determinism) of WHILE programs? What are asymptotic complexity classes and what are their limitations? What do we know about existence of optimal solutions?Advanced Natural Language Engineering×15 creditsSpring Teaching, Year 3Advanced Natural Language Engineering builds on the foundations provided by the Natural Language Engineering module.

Neural Networks×15 creditsSpring Teaching, Year 3To take this module you must already be able to write software in one appropriate programming language such as Java, C, Python, or Matlab. Basic knowledge of formal computational skills is also a prerequisite. In recent years neural computing has emerged as a practical technology with applications in many fields. The majority of these applications are concerned with problems in pattern recognition, and make use of feed-­forward network architectures such as the multi­layer perceptron and the radial basis function network. It is widely acknowledged that the successful application of neural computing requires a principled approach, and this module will use the recent advances in neural computing to explore neural networks in-depth. By concentrating on the pattern-recognition aspects of neural networks, the module will cover many important topics such as: spiking neural networks multi­layer perception radial basis function network support vector machines competitive learning independent component analysis.
