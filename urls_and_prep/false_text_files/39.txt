Did you ever wonder how emails get sent, how Google works, how to develop your own computer game? Are you interested in understanding what goes on behind the scenes at Amazon or eBay? Do you want to know what an MP3 file actually is or how podcasting and ITunes work? Then this programme is for you. As well as answering these questions, this programme will prepare you to work as a software application developer in a variety of commercial and industrial environments. It will equip you with the understanding and skills needed in an exciting and constantly changing industry. What are my... Career Opportunities? Graduates of this programme will be uniquely qualified in a wide range of computer development areas. These may be in the mainstream computer industry but will also occur in stimulating, leading application areas such as Internet Applications Development, Games Development, Enterprise Systems, E-Commerce, Music Technology, Systems Technology, Systems Security, Knowledge Management and Data Mining. Graduates of this programme will also be well qualified to pursue postgraduate studies to MSc, MPhil and PhD levels. What other options do I have after completion? Students who have reached the appropriate honours standard may have access to a range of Masters Degrees in DIT and elsewhere in Higher Education. Learning Outcomes: What will I study on this programme? You will spend the early years of the course gaining a thorough grounding in the fundamentals of computer science, you will spend the middle part of the programme developing highly relevant skills in software design and development, and in final year you will have the opportunity to specialise your knowledge and skills in a variety of areas, including Enterprise Systems Development: Where you will learn how to create large, scalable, safe, secure and reliable software systems using the latest technologies. Applied Intelligence: Where you will learn about advanced methods in computer science which can be applied in business (e.g. predicting trends) and elsewhere (e.g. robotics). Digital Games Development & Simulation: Where you will learn how to design and implement computer games and simulated environments which model novel and complex worlds and characters. The third year of the programme is focused on experiential learning. You will participate in a business and enterprise module, and may then opt to participate in our highly successful work placement programme. Our work placement programmes’s success is due to the close liaison we have developed and maintained with industry partners throughout the history of our school. Alternatively, you can work with community organisations on our innovative service-learning module, whereby you take responsibility for significant ICT projects in the community. The school has institutional links with many industrial leaders such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Datalex and Computer Associates through sponsorship, work placement and project co-operation.

I got a great internship during third year and was able to learn lots about large systems making me ready for a career after college. I value being one of the graduates from this course, as it did not just help me develop concrete skills that reflected the state-of-the-art technologies, but also offered me an opportunity to obtain industrial experience as part of the curriculum. There is a heavy emphasis on gaining practical and applicable skills for today’s marketplace, however this is complemented very well by theory based modules which allow you to take step back from the technical details and understand why you’re doing something in a particular way. I found the lecturers very approachable and helpful at all times. The learning environment was very open and tutorials often involved lively debates and discussions. I also learned about cutting-edge technologies under the guidance of highly knowledgeable and approachable staff.
