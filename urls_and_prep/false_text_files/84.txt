Our faculty includes world-renowned experts in fields that include innovative new memory and computing devices, new computing architectures, low-power thermal-aware, mobile and sustainable cyber-systems, and many others.  We also have state of the art instruction and research laboratories housed in two campus buildings. A recently renovated floor in the Engineering building, Benedum Hall, includes brand new testing equipment, computing clusters, and an innovative “maker” space (SERC) designed for product-style entrepreneurship and innovation.   The computer science building, Sennott Square, contains the Gillotti Interactive Learning Suite and state of the art facilities such as the Eli Lilly Conferencing Center. While we still retain a strong representation of students from Western Pennsylvania, our programs are internationally recognized, drawing students from all over the world. Computer Engineering maintains a student-first mentality with a focus on instruction and mentorship.  This approach allows our faculty and students to accomplish great things together, as leaders in innovation of new technologies.  Please take a moment to visit our individual program pages, which contain information about our curricula, certifications, and activities. Thanks for visiting!Sincerely,Alex K. Jones, PhD Director, Computer Engineering Associate Professor, Electrical and Computer Engineering Computer Engineering ProgramThe CoE curriculum focuses on the design, production, operation, and maintenance of computers and digital systems. In addition, computer engineers are involved with the applications of computers and digital technology. Courses include Java, Digital Logic, Linear Systems and Circuits, Digital Laboratory, Computer Interfacing, and Software Engineering. Computer Engineers work as Chip Designers, Application Developers, Software Designers, and Digital Television and Photography Developers. No background in computers or programming is necessary to be in the CoE program.Learn more about the undergraduate programUndergraduate Learn more about the graduate programGraduate swanson school of engineering University of Pittsburgh | Benedum Hall 3700 O'Hara Street | Pittsburgh, PA 15261 Contact    |    Visit Us Departments Bioengineering Chemical & Petroleum Civil & Environmental Electrical & Computer Industrial Mechanical & Materials Explore Faculty Directory Staff Listing Alumni First Year Diversity Quick Links Legal Information Open Positions Awards my.pitt.edu Web Support
