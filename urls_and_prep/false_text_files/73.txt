Info Social Data Analytics, B.S. Social Data Analytics is an interdisciplinary major designed to prepare students for careers that make use of “big” data in order to tackle social and political problems. The major integrates courses in the social sciences with relevant ones in statistics, mathematics, information science, and computer science to develop the unique skill set necessary to analyze and contextualize data sources, to think critically about “big” data in relation to specific real world problems, and to derive and test hypotheses through application of data tools and techniques. In addition, SODA majors will gain practical experience working with data through a capstone project and participation in faculty research.
