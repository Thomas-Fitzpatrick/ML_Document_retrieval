It is also home to authors of leading textbooks, a National Teaching Fellow and two Association of Computer Machinery (ACM) award-winning scientists. Our Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Research is accredited by GCHQ. The wide-ranging expertise of our teaching staff means you have the chance to explore a large choice of subjects, from artificial intelligence and computer security to parallel systems and mobile computing. This programme has full Chartered IT Professional (CITP) accreditation from BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT. Our degree programme Our programme focuses on the technical aspects of computer science. The first language you learn is Java, the standard programming language for many mobile devices and widely used in the industry. Other areas covered include software engineering, network technology and human-computer interaction. You learn how to develop software, program mobile devices and discover the underlying protocols on which the internet runs. The programme is flexible; you take a broad range of compulsory modules in your first and second years and can select from a variety of options in your final year of study, so is ideal if you want to keep your options open. We also offer modules that allow you to gain practical experience. On our Kent IT Consultancy option, you learn how to become an IT consultant, providing computing support to local businesses while earning credits towards your degree. You can also gain experience in teaching with our Computing in the Classroom module, which gives you the opportunity to apply your knowledge in a school setting. Year in industry You have the option to take Computer Science with a year on professional placement. You don’t have to make a decision before you enrol at Kent but certain conditions apply: see Computer Science with a Year in Industry. In previous years, students have worked at a wide range of large and small organisations, including well-known names such as: Accenture BTGSKIBM Kent Police Microsoft Morgan Stanley The Walt Disney Company. You can take your work placement abroad. Previous destinations include Hong Kong and the USA. Themed degree You can also take Computer Science as a themed degree – Artificial Intelligence, Consultancy, or Networks. For more details, see Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence), Computer Science (Consultancy), Computer Science (Networks). Study resources Facilities to support the study of Computer Science include The Shed, the School of Computing's Makerspace, which houses: 3D printers laser-cutting facilities development equipment, including Oculus Rift and Raspberry Pi. Students also have exclusive access to a computer room and common room, and we run a peer-mentoring scheme. Extra activities Computer Science students often take part in TinkerSoc, a student-run 'tinkering' society which meets in 'The Shed', our collaborative workspace. TinkerSoc welcomes all students who like making things. Whether a member of TinkerSoc or not, you can spend time in The Shed, making, exploring and sharing. In this informal environment you can build physical devices for your coursework, as well as develop your own interests and hobbies. The School of Computing also hosts events that you are welcome to attend. These include our successful seminar programme where guest speakers from academia and industry discuss current developments in the field. We also host the BCS local branch events on campus. In addition, you can join the Kent Computing Society, which is run by students and provides networking opportunities with industry professionals as well as access to valuable knowledge and resources to help you develop your skills outside of your course. Professional network Our successful year in industry programmes have allowed us to build up excellent relationships with leading companies such as BAE Systems, Citigroup and The Walt Disney Company. Think Kent video series In this lecture, Dr Mark Batty from the School of Computing explores how mathematics can be used to better specify and design computer systems. He makes the case that computer systems should not be built above prose specifications and that a solid basis for computer-system engineering does not exist. Independent rankings Computer Science at Kent was ranked 12th for graduate prospects in The Complete University Guide 2017. Of Computer Science students at Kent who graduated in 2015, 92% were in work or further study within six months (DLHE). Of those who went into employment, 95% found professional jobs.

Typically, a project will involve the specification, design, implementation, documentation and demonstration of a technical artefact. The project is supervised by a member of the academic staff, who holds weekly meetings with the group, during which s/he will give general advice and will assess the progress of the group and the contributions by individual students. Project deliverables are:-	a technical report, in the style of an academic paper, describing the scientific/technical outcome of the project; -	a well-indexed corpus of material that supports the achievements claimed. In addition, each individual prepares a report outlining his/her contributions to each of the various aspects of the project. This report should not be a repeat of other material delivered as part of the project, but an assessment of the progress of the project and reflections on what the individual has learnt from undertaking it. In particular, it should include a description of the particular activities and outcomes that individual has contributed to the project, and of how the group worked together. This report will be discussed at a viva voce examination which should include a short presentation/demonstration of the project.

They may take hotspots: brief sessions with the whole class where they explain a technical topic or talk about aspects of university life. They must keep a weekly log of their activities. Each student must also devise a special project in consultation with the teacher and with the module convener. They must then implement and evaluate the project.

Full details of our terms and conditions can be found at: www.kent.ac.uk/termsandconditions. *Where fees are regulated (such as by the Department for Education or Research Council UK) permitted increases are normally inflationary and the University therefore reserves the right to increase tuition fees by inflation (RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) as permitted by law or Government policy in the second and subsequent years of your course. If we intend to exercise this right to increase tuition fees, we will let you know by the end of June in the academic year before the one in which we intend to exercise that right. If, in the future, the increases to regulated fees permitted by law or Government policy exceed the rate of inflation, we reserve the right to increase fees to the maximum permitted level.
