It requires the application of both computer engineering and computer science principles and practices to the creation, operation, and maintenance of software systems and applications. The Software Engineering Option of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree at the University of Miami is a unique interdisciplinary program developed and administered collaboratively by the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science. This Option prepares students for successful careers in software engineering. Software systems are becoming increasingly complex, and emerging technologies are pushing the boundaries of reusable components and software quality assurance. To prepare students to meet these challenges, this Option establishes a solid foundation of software system fundamentals, coupled with strong hands-on experience and an understanding of professional practice and conduct. In addition to the core curriculum in software engineering, students are introduced to the paradigms of real-time, adaptive, and collaborative software systems, through a wide range of technical elective courses from both the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science. Students may also use courses from other departments with academic advisor approval. The technical electives allow students to apply the knowledge they have gained to different application areas. This provides valuable hands-on experience in contemporary application areas, which enhances the students’ potential career development opportunities. Students pursuing the Software Engineering Option of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree must earn at least 15 credit hours in Computer Science as part of their degree requirements.
