Students majoring in mathematics may choose between the regular math major and the double major. Regular math majors must complete: MATH 101 and 102 Single Variable Calculus I and II MATH 211 Ordinary Differential Equations and Linear Algebra and MATH 212 Multivariable Calculus; or MATH 221 and 222 Honors Calculus III and IV At least 24 semester hours (eight courses) in departmental courses at the 300 level or above (in many instances, the math department will waive the 100- and 200-level courses for a math major) At most 3 credit hours from MATH courses numbered 490 to 499 One Possible Degree Path for B.A. Degree The requirements for the double major are the same except that students may substitute approved mathematics-related courses for up to nine of the 24 hours required at the 300 level or above. At most 3 credit hours from MATH courses numbered 490 to 499 may be applied to the double major. Students receive advanced placement credit for MATH 101 by achieving a score of four or five on the AP AB-level test and for MATH 101 and 102 by achieving a score of four or five on the BC-level test. Students who have had calculus but have not taken the AP test may petition the department for a waiver of the calculus requirements. Entering students should enroll in the most advanced course commensurate with their background; advice is available from the mathematics faculty during Orientation Week and at other times. Disclaimer: Official requirements for the BA in Mathematics Degree are posted in the General Announcements on the Registrar's website (available here). Please note that these are the definitive version. Degree requirements for BS in Mathematics These requirements are in addition to general university graduation requirements. The chair of the undergraduate committee of the MATH department may modify requirements to meet the needs of students with advanced backgrounds. Required courses include: Single variable calculus: MATH 101 and 102; Differential equations: MATH 211, 381, or 423; Multivariable calculus: MATH 212, or both 221 and 222 Linear algebra: MATH 221, 354, or 355; Real analysis: two classes taken from MATH 321/331, 322, or 425; Algebra: MATH 356 and 463; Geometry and manifolds: MATH 370, 401, or 402; Complex analysis: MATH 382 or 427; Topology: MATH 443, 444, or 445; One Possible Degree Path for B.S. Degree A total of at least 33 credit hours in MATH (e.g., 11 three-hour courses) at the 300 level or above is required. Students may choose electives to reach this number and at most 3 credit hours from MATH courses numbered 490 to 499 Disclaimer: Official requirements for the BS in Mathematics will be posted in the next edition of the General Announcements on the Registrar's website. Please note that these will be the definitive version.
