Students from Mainland China, and some international students, will study a four-year programme including a preliminary year (year one), which is spent developing English language and academic writing skills. Direct entry into the qualifying year (sometimes referred to as year two entry) of an undergraduate degree is possible for those whose school qualifications are equivalent to A level, International Baccalaureate (IB) or similar. Students entering this year will not complete the preliminary year course. Some of our undergraduate courses offer the opportunity to spend your final two years studying at our UK Campus. For those studying four-year courses these are referred to as 2+2 courses, while for those on three-year programmes they are called 1+2.
