The programs offered by the UCSC Economics Department are designed to acquaint students with the broad range of issues studied by economists and the tools they use. The department offers three majors and two combined majors: * Economics     * Business Management Economics     * Global Economics     * Economics/Mathematics     * Economics/Environmental Studies     * Minor     * Field Study Program A minor in economics is also available, as is a combined major of economics with mathematics, and a combined major of economics with environmental studies. The economics curriculum begins at the introductory level; no specific high school preparation is required. All economics majors study a substantial core of economic theory and mathematical and statistical methods, and are then able to choose among a wide variety of upper-division electives. Economics majors may combine their upper-division elective choices in a variety of ways to achieve specialization in a number of possible areas.
