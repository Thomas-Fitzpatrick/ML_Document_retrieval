What does a Computer Engineer do? They analyze, design and implement creative solutions to problems with computer hardware, software, systems and applications. They contribute effectively as team members, communicate clearly and interact responsibly with colleagues, clients, employers and society. The curriculum has been carefully designed to assure that students obtain an excellent background in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. All Computer Engineering students work through an extended sequence of introductory, intermediate and advanced courses in both areas. (Please see Core Curriculum below). Faculty from the Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering departments jointly administer the CpE undergraduate degree program at the University of Virginia. The Computer Engineering Program does not currently offer a minor.

The undergraduate record represent the official repository for academic program requirements. These publications may be found here. Please refer to the Undergraduate Record for detailed information including HSS electives.  SEAS Guidelines such as Course Load, Academic Probation and Academic Suspension can also be found in the Record. Computer Engineering Undergraduate Program Accreditation Information Accreditation Information and Graduation Data The Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree offered jointly by the Department of Computer Science and the Charles L. Brown Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. http://www.abet.org. Graduation data for these degree programs is included on this page that provides such information for all SEAS undergraduate degrees. Each degree program has defined Program Educational Objectives (PEOs), which are broad statements that describe the career and professional accomplishments that the program is preparing graduates to achieve. In addition, each program has defined Student Outcomes (SOs), which are are narrower statements that describe what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of graduation. These relate to the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that students acquire in their matriculation through the program. Program Educational Objectives for the BSCpE Graduates of the Computer Engineering program at the University of Virginia utilize their academic preparation to become successful practitioners and innovators in computer engineering and other fields.  They analyze, design and implement creative solutions to problems with computer hardware, software, systems and applications. They contribute effectively as team members, communicate clearly and interact responsibly with colleagues, clients, employers and society. Student Outcomes for the BSCpE The BS in Computer Engineering program at the University of Virginia enables students to achieve, by the time of graduation: (1) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering. (2) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data. (3) an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability. (4) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams (understanding perspectives, communication). (5) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems. (6) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility. (7) an ability to communicate effectively. (8) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context. (9) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning. (10) a knowledge of contemporary issues (technical , nontechnical). (11) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.
