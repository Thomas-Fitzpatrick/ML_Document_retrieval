The program places an emphasis on understanding the mechanisms underlying the normal and pathological functions of animal organisms in terms of the physical and chemical laws that govern them. It is this integrative approach, spanning the basic science spectrum, that places the discipline of physiology at the forefront in the education of future health science professionals. An undergraduate major in physiology leads to a B.A. degree through the College of Liberal Arts. The major can accommodate students interested in any of several fields related to health and biological sciences. Our graduates can be found in medical, dental, pharmacy, physical therapy and nursing degree programs. The flexibility of our course of study allows students to tailor their coursework to their academic and career interests.We encourage you to explore our program and consider physiology as you choose your undergraduate major.—Vincent Barnett, Director of Undergraduate Studies Undergraduate Physiology Society The Undergraduate Physiology Society (UPS) or (U-PHYS) was founded in 2009. We are student-governed, and affiliated with the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, with Dr. Vincent Barnett as our advisor. Although many members are physiology majors, this is not a requirement for membership, and we encourage non-majors to attend our meetings and events. Connect with us on Facebook Declaring your majorPost-baccalaureate opportunitiesPrograms and OrganizationsStudent resources Declaring your major Make an appointment Advising appointments with Dr. Barnett can be scheduled at: Physiology Major Advising. In preparation for your meeting, please complete our Education Background Form and bring a copy of it to the advising session.  If you cannot find a physiology advising appointment time slot that fits your schedule using the schedule site, please contact Dr. Barnett (barne014@umn.edu) or the Physiology Office (ibpdept@umn.edu) to request a specific date and/or time.  Requests for appointments that do not fit into the posted advising schedule will be accomodated when possible.In addition, the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology would very much appreciate you filling out a short questionnaire rating your meeting(s) with Dr. Barnett. Thank you!Vincent Barnett Office Location:3-136 Jackson HallIntegrative Biology and Physiology Department6-125 Jackson Hall612-625-5902LATE POLICY: We will hold your appointment for five minutes, but if you miss your appointment, your time slot may be assigned to another student and you will have to reschedule. Post-baccalaureate opportunities Employment: The physiology degree is intended primarily as preparation for graduate or professional study. If supplemented with several laboratory courses as well as laboratory experience, the B.A. degree may be adequate for obtaining an entry level position such as a laboratory technician or research assistant. When combined with a degree in fields such as chemistry, electrical engineering, or computer science, the B.A. in physiology could be helpful in obtaining positions in the biomedical industry. Graduate Study: The undergraduate major is flexible enough to allow the student to prepare for post baccalaureate study in Physiology, Neuroscience, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Cell Biology, and other areas of biomedical science. Professional School: The major is often chosen by students planning to continue their education in health fields including, but not limited to, medicine or dentistry. There is considerable overlap between the requirements for the physiology degree and the admission requirements of many professional schools. Notes for Physiology Pre-Meds Is medicine the right career for you?Find out about medicine as a career and make a decision to apply to medical school based on your informed interest. At a minimum, you should enjoy biology and have a real desire to be involved in the treatment of human disease. Clinical medicine involves dealing with people, often in situations that require great discipline but may sometimes lack glamour or even intellectual challenge. Medical schools will look for evidence that helping people with health and other problems is a natural part of your life. This is important not only for the quality of the contribution that you can make to medicine, but also for your own satisfaction with the career. Do you qualify for medical school?Develop excellent academic credentials. You must make very good grades. Take your courses very seriously from the beginning of your undergraduate experience. You should also structure your undergraduate program to include certain courses. There are two reasons for this. First, medical schools expect these courses to be on your transcript. Second, you need appropriate background to do well on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) . The coursework required for the physiology major is essentially a subset of "pre-med" courses, making the major an excellent choice for students who are interested in medical school.Keep in mind that when you apply to medical school, you will also need letters from individuals who know you well and who can strongly support your application. Begin early to develop relationships with people who can provide this support. The best letters will come from well-respected individuals who are in a position to evaluate you critically and fully, who strongly believe in your potential, and who have experience and skill in writing letters of reference. A good example would be a class professor with whom you also did a special laboratory or library project. The longer and the more extensive your relationship, the more valuable his or her letter will likely be. Have I done all I can do to prepare myself?Get complete advice from the right sources as early as possible in your academic life. Health Science Resources: The Health Careers Center offers a variety of ways to help you put your best foot forward when applying to medical school or another health professional program. Resources include: online workshops to help with preparing for medical school, writing your personal statement, and developing interviewing skills; courses to guide you in learning more about becoming a physician, gaining relevant experience, or simply finding a health career that is a fit for you; a resource library; and much more!
