You are here:Home / Study / Undergraduate Study / Undergraduate Programs / Computer Science Computer ScienceBSc undergraduate program Computer Science lies at the core of all modern industries, as computer systems and information technology are the basis for almost all of today’s production processes. Computer technology changes constantly but there are a number of fundamental principles underlying these technologies. The Computer Science program at Jacobs University focuses on understanding these principles and their application in practice. In addition to courses dealing with core competencies (programming, software engineering, foundations of computer science), you will be covering mathematics (calculus, linear algebra, and statistics) and take courses in engineering and sciences whilst also conducting guided research. Meet one of our Alumni: Daniel Alonso Garcia Rodriguez Program Structure and Content Year 1 Take 3 CHOICE Modules, at least one free selection General Computer ScienceThe introductory module General Computer Science covers abstract and concrete notions of computing machines, information, and algorithms. You will develop an understanding of the mathematical foundations of computer science. Core concepts such as algorithms, computations, and complexity will be introduced. The module also introduces you to basic data structures and elementary sort and search algorithms. You will learn how to represent graphs and how basic graph algorithms work. By studying elementary algorithms in depth, you will learn how to prove properties of algorithms such as their complexity. The module finally introduces you to different programming paradigms and how to approach and solve programming problems in a systematic way. The object-oriented programming paradigm and object-oriented design patterns will be studied in some depths. Year 2 Take 3 CORE Modules, at least 2 from study program Applied Computer ScienceThe Applied Computer Science module familiarizes you with core components used by many modern computer applications such as relational databases and associated query languages. You will learn how to use web application frameworks and you will learn the foundations of computer graphics, such as rendering, shading, lighting, or textures. The module also introduces you to tools and techniques that can be used to develop software in a structured way in order to control development efforts and costs while improving the overall software quality. Technical Computer ScienceThe Technical Computer Science module introduces you to systems-oriented aspects of computer science. You will learn how an operating system kernel organizes a collection of hardware components into useful programming abstractions. Concurrent programming will be introduced and the various techniques to prevent race conditions and to coordinate concurrent activities. You will learn how computer programs can communicate. You will understand the purpose of the different layers of computer networks and how the Internet works. Basic distributed algorithms will be introduced that allow you to build robust and scalable distributed applications. Theoretical Computer ScienceThe Theoretical Computer Science module covers the formal foundations of computer science. You will learn about different classes of formal languages and how they relate to discrete automata. You will learn what it means for a function to be computable and that there are functions that are impossible to compute. You will learn how to classify computable problems according to their inherent difficulty. Finally, you will learn how to use first-order logic to reason about programs and how to write programs using programming languages that are based on first-order logic. Year 3 Take CAREER Modules, choose between World and Campus Track 1.
