Undergraduate Major: Pharmacology and Drug Development · USC School of Pharmacy Skip to content University of Southern California USC School of Pharmacy Menu USC School of Pharmacy HomeProgramsUndergraduate ProgramsUndergraduate Major: Pharmacology and Drug Development Undergraduate Major: Pharmacology and Drug Development USC undergraduate students have the option of pursuing a major, new in the 2017-18 academic year, in Pharmacology and Drug Development.  Faculty at the School of Pharmacy specifically developed many of the new courses within the major to help better prepare undergraduates focused on pre-pharmacy, pre-medicine and other health-related professions.  Students in the Trojan Admission Pre-Pharmacy (TAP) program are strongly encouraged to pursue this major as part of their undergraduate training, or at the minimum, take several of the new pharmacy-related courses as part of their overall undergraduate experience. This major will provide a new path for science and non-science majors to gain significant knowledge in pharmacology, toxicology and medical product development and use. Completion of the major will better prepare USC undergraduates for advanced clinical training in health related fields including pharmacy, medicine, and dentistry.  Moreover, the completion of coursework within the major will provide foundational education for careers in biotech, pharmaceutics and biomedical industries. Click here to view a full list of courses.
