What students are saying about Software Engineering (Computer Science) One of the best things about this program is the professors, all of whom have shown interest in my success and knowledge. They’ve been great guides, references and supporters throughout my experience. Be it a question on course material or on which stream to switch into, they’re easy to talk to and very helpful. I’ve also learned so much, both inside the and outside the classroom thanks to the research I was fortunate enough to be a part of.
