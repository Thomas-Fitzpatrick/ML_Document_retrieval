The program provides a solid foundation in Computer Science blended with an interdisciplinary field of their choices such as Digital Media, Business, Economics and more and permits flexible elective courses to be taken outside of the discipline.The program prepares students to gain knowledge and experience in the fundamentals of computer science, including computer organization and architecture, data structures and related algorithms, and programming languages as well as technical skills and application of technology. The B.A. in Computer Science is SACS accredited, but unlike our B.S. in Computer Science, it is non-ABET accredited.Catalog Description Flowchart Plan of StudyCS PrerequisitesStudents should have completed the following courses (or equivalent) prior to starting the BA in Computer Science.MAC1140 Pre-CalculusSTA2023 Statistics for Business and EconomicsCS Core CoursesCDA3103 Fundamentals of Computer SystemsCDA4101 Structured Computer OrganizationCEN4010 Software Engineering 1CGS1920 Introduction to Computing OR COP1000 Intro to Programming OR IDC1000 Computer Science for EveryoneCGS3095 Technology in the Global ArenaCNT4713 Net-centric ComputingCOP2210 Computer Programming 1COP3337 Computer Programming 2COP3530 Data StructuresCOP4338 Computer Programming 3COP4610 Operating Systems PrinciplesCOP4710 Database ManagementENC3249 Professional and Technical Writing for CSCOT3100 Discrete Structures OR MAD2104 Discrete MathematicsCS Elective CoursesChoose three elective courses from the following list or as approved by advisor.CAP4630 Artificial IntelligenceCAP4641 Natural Language ProcessingCAP4770 Data MiningCOP4005 Windows ProgrammingCEN4021 Software Engineering 2CEN4072 Software TestingCEN4083 Introduction to Cloud ComputingCOP4226 Advanced Windows ProgrammingCOP4520 Introduction to Parallel ComputingCOP4534 Algorithm TechniquesCOP4555 Principles of Programming LanguagesCOP4604 Advanced UNIX ProgrammingCOP4722 Survey of Database SystemsCOT3541 Logic for Computer ScienceCOT4521 Computational GeometryCTS4408 Database AdministrationMAD3305 Graph TheoryMAD3512 Introduction to Theory of AlgorithmsInterdisciplinary CreditsNine credits must be taken outside SCIS. These nine credits must be applicable to a minor or certificate in another discipline.FAQ What do I need to do to change my major to the BA in CS?You will need to stop by the SCIS Advising office in PG6-100 to meet with an advisor. What is ABET?ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation. It accredits college and university programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering and engineering technology at the associate, bachelor and master degree levels. What is the difference between the BS and the BA in Computer Science?The BS in Computer Science (BS in CS) is heavy in math and science courses and the BA in Computer Science (BA in CS) is not. Some courses that are required for the BS in CS that are not required for the BA in CS is: Calculus1, Calculus 2, Physics with Calculus 1, Physics with Calculus 2 and Senior Project. Also, the BS in CS degree is accredited by ABET and the BA in CS degree is not.
