This is the codebase for my final year project titled "An Online Document Retrieval and Classification System based on
Information Retrieval and Machine Learning Techniques".

The anaconda package manager is recommended. Addidionally, the following packages must be installed:
    PyPDF2
    urllib
    pandas
    numpy
    sklearn
    nltk

There are three folders:

1. analysis:
    Holds the samples taken for analyzing the precision and recall of the various runs documented in the report.

2. crawler_code:
    Holds the system's implementation, as described in the project report. This consists of:
        1. The crawler class, which forms the basis of the crawling operation.
        2. The Priority Queue class, which is used in the implementation of the URL Frontier, as described in
        Section 4.1.1 of the report.
        3. Random_forest class, which is used to train the Random Forest classifier. As described in Section 4.2.1 of
        the report.
        4. svm_classifier class, which is used to train the Support Vector Machine classifier. As described in
        Section 4.2.1 of the report.
        5. build_data_set class, which is used for parsing the training sets for the classifiers.

3. data:
    Holds folders for all of the various experiments performed during evaluation of the system.
    Each one contains:
        1. A python "Run" file, which contains the specifications of an exeperiment and allows it to be run.
        2. A set of urls which are for syllabi. The "Positive set"
        3. A set of urls which are not syllabi. The "Negative set"
        4. A dataset file, generated by the Run file. This contains the downloaded and parsed training examples. Saving
        means that a run can be performed without having to first download and parse all the examples.
        5. A found_syllabi json and csv format output. This contains the output of the experiment. All of the found
        syllabi. They are stored with the seed link that they originated from.
        6. A stats file, which is the result of the testing performed on whatever classifier  was used in the system.
        7. A model_info file which explaines the purpose of the particular experiment.

Within the data folder, the first 1_Model_Example folder, is designed to explain the running of an experiment. It contains
sample datasets and a run file which explains the purpose of all the parameters, as discussed in Section 4.4 of the
report.
